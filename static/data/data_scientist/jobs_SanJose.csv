 We’re creating an entirely new payments platform, built with stablecoins, to simplify global money movement. Bridge enables faster, cheaper payments and borderless access to dollars via stablecoins. Through our APIs, businesses can send and receive funds across borders faster / cheaper vs. SWIFT and other fiat\\-only rails. Our virtual accounts enable international consumers and businesses to easily access, store and spend US dollars. Our payouts infrastructure enables platforms to disburse USD to anyone globally. We believe many trillions of dollars will move and settle through stablecoin payment rails. Bridge is pulling this future forward.
   

  

 We have a small team of people who have previously built financial infrastructure at some of the world’s leading companies (Coinbase, Stripe, Square, Brex, Upstart, DoorDash, Airbnb) and each and every one of them chose Bridge because they fundamentally believe that stablecoins will be a critical piece of financial infrastructure that allows for the improvement of global money movement.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As an early member of the Bridge engineering team, you will be given the autonomy to work on projects that are truly global in scale and aim to give customers access to products they've never had access to. Many of the use cases that we work on today didn't exist several months ago and that's because our team is dedicated to constant improvement for our partners and end users. Our Engineers have outsized ownership over projects so if you are looking for increased autonomy working on a completely greenfield opportunity, Bridge is the place for you.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Ship software to build out our suite of API products. We’re an engineering and API\\-first company, and you will learn first\\-hand and contribute towards building highly reliable, performant, and mission critical infrastructure serving thousands of developers across the globe.
* Take sole ownership of projects, oftentimes without the support of Product Management, and liaise both internally with teams like Legal/Compliance and externally with our partners and developers.
* Look for constant improvements to our product offerings with the explicit goal of improving the experience for our partners and end users.
* Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation.
* Improve engineering standards, tooling and processes for the team and our broader org.


**Qualifications**
* We are open to hiring engineers at various levels of seniority (SWE through Senior Staff) but at a minimum we are looking for somebody with 5\\+ years of experience.
* Experience building backend systems with SQL databases. Experience with frameworks such as Rails, Django, Express or equivalent is a bonus.
* An enlarged sense of ownership and the ability to lead and influence the design and direction of our products.
* An ability to thrive in a fast paced environment.
* A growth mindset and a constant curiosity and fearlessness to dive into the unknown.
* An ability to write maintainable, well\\-tested, modular code, but also be pragmatic about moving fast.
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to write clear technical documentation.
* Past experience working on crypto or financial products a plus, and while not required, we do look for people who are very passionate about building in this space.
* Experience with building API products a plus, but not required.
* Experience working with blockchain or distributed systems a big plus


 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in\\-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in\\-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
   

  

 Pay and benefits
   

  

 The annual US base salary range for this role is $187,500 \\- $281,300\\. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location.

**About The Role**
 We’re looking for a
 **Full\\-Stack Engineer** 
 with strong
 **backend and DevOps background** 
 to help build and evolve internal tools that power AI research and evaluation. This role sits at the intersection of backend architecture, infrastructure automation, and developer experience — with the larger goal of improving how we measure and ensure the quality and safety of AI systems.You’ll collaborate closely with
 **machine\\-learning researchers, data scientists, PMs, and engineers** 
 , translating complex research workflows into robust, scalable systems. While your primary focus will be on backend services, data models, and infrastructure, you’ll also occasionally contribute to
 **frontend development** 
 to help shape cohesive, user\\-friendly interfaces that bring research workflows to life.
 **What You’ll Work On**
* Designing and implementing backend APIs and data models using modern web frameworks (e.g. Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Node.js / Adonis, or Python / FastAPI)
* Managing MongoDB schemas and performing safe data migrations for live research datasets
* Building and maintaining Dockerized applications and CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes / Argo CD environments
* Maintaining and versioning APIs and SDKs following Semantic Versioning (SemVer), and communicating updates clearly to internal users
* Working directly with internal customers to understand workflows, gather requirements, and translate them into actionable engineering tasks
* Automating developer processes and improving tooling and developer experience across the platform
* Occasionally contributing to frontend development (React or similar frameworks) to integrate new backend features or streamline researcher\\-facing workflows


**What You Bring**
* Strong backend development experience with at least one modern web framework (Laravel, Rails, Node.js / Adonis, or Python / FastAPI)
* Proficiency with Docker and containerized application development
* Experience with MongoDB and schema evolution in production environments
* Familiarity with Kubernetes, Argo CD, or similar DevOps platforms
* Understanding of CI/CD, API versioning, and SDK publishing workflows
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills — comfortable engaging with internal users, clarifying requirements, and turning feedback into practical solutions
* A customer\\-first mindset and enthusiasm for improving internal tooling and developer experience
* A strong work ethic, eagerness to learn new systems and technologies, and the ability to connect disparate tools and architectures into cohesive solutions
* An open, reflective approach — you learn from past experiences without being biased toward past solutions
* Bonus: experience or curiosity in machine\\-learning evaluation, data visualization, Amazon S3, or authentication and security best practices


**Why This Role Matters**
 You’ll help bridge the gap between
 **research and engineering** 
 , enabling teams to evaluate and iterate on AI models more efficiently and responsibly. Your work will directly contribute to improving the
 **quality, reliability, and safety of AI systems** 
 — not by training models, but by building the infrastructure that helps everyone understand them better.This is an opportunity to shape the tools that shape research itself — within a small, collaborative team that values thoughtful design, experimentation, and real\\-world impact.

 Unusual helps brands discover and change how AI models talk about them.
   

  

 People are increasingly using AI to make big buying decisions in their life – but brands have no control or visibility into what AI is telling their customers. Unusual puts control back in brands’ hands.
   

  

 We work with fast\\-growing companies including Reducto, Monarch, and more, and our team has experience from MIT, Princeton, and SpaceX.
   

  

 Under the hood, Unusual surveys models with thousands of targeted probing questions to understand how they form their opinions. We examine the sources they pull from, and find patterns in their reasoning that let us create content and PR engineered to change those models' minds.
   

  

 A typical Unusual customer sees more than a 40% increase in traffic from AI models within a month of going live. Our customers have used Unusual to shift models' perception of their brand from ""niche"" to ""enterprise\\-platform"", from ""scrappy"" to ""customer\\-obsessed"", and from ""good for startups"" to ""a solid bet for the middle market"".
   

  

 The Role
   

  

**Skills:** 
 Python, TypeScript, AWS, experience with LLM applications, Docker. Being a hacker – enjoying getting stuff done independently.
   

  

**Scope:** 
 You’ll work with the founders to understand customer needs and product bottlenecks, and translate those into an engineering roadmap for the team to chase down. It’s an early stage company, so you’ll be wearing many hats.
   

  

**Why work at Unusual?**
* You have a chance to help define an entire new technical field and market. We're essentially doing applied psychology on LLMs. We think that's pretty cool, and extremely valuable.
* We're riding a huge tailwind. While many AI companies may be threatened by a bubble, we think the usage of tools like ChatGPT is only going to increase. The need for our product is only going to get greater.
* We aim to be the premium solution in the space \\-\\- we pull no punches when it comes to making the product smarter and better, and pricing accordingly. As an engineer, this means you can do your best technical work at Unusual.


**Culture and Values**
* Character comes first. We only work with people we deeply trust and respect. We think this makes work more fun, freeing, and effective.
* We try to remain down to earth and in touch with customer's real pains. Everyone at Unusual works in the customer service department.
* We do whatever it takes. When we know what we must do, we don't take shortcuts or shy away from huge ugly challenges. That means we work pretty hard, and occasionally have to do some big sprints.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/unusual-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQH4SPOsCl2dXQ/company-logo_100_100/B56Zp5w.ckKAAQ-/0/1762979473463/unusual_ai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Uvz3SURFlRGIrxN93mIDVF-kqgllTT4ORDTAlx9lV3s","","","","","","","","","","",""

* Own major product areas and be accountable for their reliability, performance, and extensibility



**What We’re Looking For** 



* 5–7\\+ years of experience building production\\-grade products
* Strong technical breadth across the stack — React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Postgres
* Deep experience with system design and architecture decisions in fast\\-moving environments
* A track record of ownership: you've led complex features or systems end\\-to\\-end
* Passion for mentoring and sharing knowledge with teammates
* Excellent product sense: you understand what good UX looks like and how to deliver it
* High agency, low ego: you move fast, ask smart questions, and lift the team around you



**Why In\\-Person SF Matters** 




 You’ll work shoulder\\-to\\-shoulder with an exceptional team:
 


* Ex\\-Stanford, MIT, and Berkeley engineers with dozens of papers
* International Olympiad winners and medalists
* Ex\\-OpenAI engineers with 10\\+ years of domain expertise for mentorship
* Former founders who’ve closed $500k in revenue at 19 and hired 40\\+ people
* Decisions happen live, not in backlogged async threads
* A players work with A players. There’s a buzzing energy in the office. Hit the whiteboard with anyone here and you’ll understand why.



**Benefits** 



* 100% medical, dental \\& vision coverage (for you; partial for dependents)
* 401k with employer match
* Unlimited PTO \\+ federal holidays
* GrubHub stipend \\+ all meals covered in\\-office

Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.
   

  

 In\\-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in\\-office workdays.
   

  

**About The Role**
 The Monetization team makes it simple and trustworthy for customers to purchase and grow with Notion. Our work spans billing infrastructure, pricing and packaging, AI usage‑based billing, and the experiences that help customers understand what they pay for.
   

  

 We’re looking for an experienced software engineer to be a technical leader on the Monetization team. You’ll focus on the foundations of how Notion charges customers: plans, entitlements, payments, invoices, and AI usage. You will work closely with product, design, finance, data, and go‑to‑market partners to ship changes that are both technically sound and business‑critical.
   

  

 This is a great role if you enjoy hard systems problems (correctness, performance, reliability) and also like seeing your work show up directly in how customers buy and use a product.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Design and evolve the architecture for Notion’s billing and pricing systems so we can launch new plans, add‑ons, and AI usage models without repeated rewrites
* Own end‑to‑end projects that touch multiple systems and teams, from early technical design through rollout and iteration
* Improve the reliability, observability, and correctness of our monetization flows (for example, preventing double‑billing, missed invoices, or quota drift)
* Partner with product and business stakeholders to turn ambiguous monetization ideas into clear technical plans and shipping milestones
* Help other engineers grow by reviewing designs and code, sharing best practices, and setting a high bar for craft on the team


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Significant experience building and operating complex backend systems in production
* Strong skills in system design, data modeling, and working with transactional, correctness‑sensitive domains
* A track record of leading projects that required coordination across multiple teams or stakeholders
* Clear, empathetic communication with both technical and non‑technical partners
* A bias toward simple, robust solutions over clever ones, and comfort working in an evolving product area like pricing and billing


**Nice To Haves**
* Experience with payments, billing, or usage‑based pricing is a plus, but not required—strong engineers who are excited about this space can ramp quickly.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures.

Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal.

It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.
   

  

 In the United States, compensation offered will be determined by factors such as location, job level, job\\-related knowledge, skills, and experience. Certain roles may be eligible for incentive compensation, equity, and benefits.

 OpenAI Labs explores the edges of what’s possible with AI. We start from the latest breakthroughs – or overlooked research with untapped potential – and expand their capabilities by prototyping entirely new ways for people to benefit from AI.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a Full\\-Stack Software Engineer on the Labs team, you will create new ways for people to interact with AI.
   

  

 Your work will begin as rapid internal experiments: prototypes built to explore surprising capabilities or novel interfaces. Some will spark entirely new products or research directions, shaping how millions of people experience AI. Across projects, you’ll ship these ideas internally, learn from how people use them, and – if they prove promising – hand them off to product teams to take forward before moving on to the next frontier.
   

  

 Sometimes you’ll start by playing with a researcher’s early demo, identify emerging behaviors, and push on them in collaboration with researchers. Other times, you’ll start from a capability that hasn’t yet been fully explored and design a novel interface around it.
   

  

 We’re looking for creative people who love to tinker and explore, chasing sparks of magic and shaping them into experiences that help the world go further and discover new possibilities.
   

  

**Location**
 This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.
   

  

**In This Role, You Will**
* Explore emerging capabilities and collaborate with researchers to uncover surprising new behaviors – whether from the model itself or from how people respond – and push their limits through creative experimentation.
* Design and prototype new interfaces and interaction patterns that rethink how people experience AI, making powerful capabilities feel intuitive, delightful, and inspiring.
* Bring ideas to life quickly, turning concepts into working demos – and evolving those prototypes into robust, testable experiences ready for real\\-world feedback.
* Ship early, learn from real usage, and iterate fast – refining ideas based on how people actually use them.
* Hand off the most promising prototypes to product teams to scale before moving on to the next frontier.


**You Might Thrive In This Role If You**
* Have demonstrated experience building and shipping full\\-stack applications, from intuitive interfaces to reliable backend systems.
* Build things for fun and care deeply about craft: curiosity drives you, and creating is how you explore ideas.
* Are energized by ambiguity and excited to turn novel capabilities into tangible, working experiences.
* Have a refined product taste and intuition for what great interactions should feel like.
* Care about how ideas work in people’s hands and evolve through real use.
* Value iteration as much as invention; refining is part of the creative process.

 This pod works at the intersection of growth, trust, and platform\\-ization. You’ll be responsible for deeply technical systems (IDV, fraud signal repositories, seller enrichment pipelines, predictive models) that directly influence GMV, seller retention, and buyer trust. The pace is fast: every week, thousands of sellers apply to sell, and your work ensures that Whatnot can confidently scale this influx without compromising marketplace integrity.

 Posting Statement
   

  

 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.
   

  

 In the United States, compensation offered will be determined by factors such as location, job level, job\\-related knowledge, skills, and experience. Certain roles may be eligible for incentive compensation, equity, and benefits. Salesforce offers a variety of benefits to help you live well including: time off programs, medical, dental, vision, mental health support, paid parental leave, life and disability insurance, 401(k), and an employee stock purchasing program. More details about company benefits can be found at the following link: https://www.salesforcebenefits.com.Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance and the Los Angeles Fair Chance Initiative for Hiring, Salesforce will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

 Postman is the world’s leading API platform, used by more than 40 million developers and 500,000 organizations, including 98% of the Fortune 500\\. Postman is helping developers and professionals across the globe build the API\\-first world by simplifying each step of the API lifecycle and streamlining collaboration—enabling users to create better APIs, faster.
   

  

 The company is headquartered in San Francisco and has offices in Boston, New York, and Bangalore \\- where Postman was founded. Postman is privately held, with funding from Battery Ventures, BOND, Coatue, CRV, Insight Partners, and Nexus Venture Partners. Learn more at postman.com or connect with Postman on X via @getpostman.
   

  

 P.S: We highly recommend reading The ""API\\-First World"" graphic novel to understand the bigger picture and our vision at Postman.
   

  

**The Opportunity**
*Please note: we at Postman try to keep levels flat so that engineering is a meritocracy. So if you see yourself or call yourself a “Senior Engineer,” an “Engineer,” or something in between, please consider applying and we’ll calibrate on level, experience, and team needs in the interview panel!*
 The API client is the core beating heart of the Postman product experience. It is what many users perceive as the entirety of Postman (although there is so much more!), and we have ambitious goals in 2024 and beyond to delight developers and simplify this central product experience. As part of this, we're looking for a Backend Engineer to bring depth, craft, and resilience to the infrastructure that underpins it all.
   

  

 We Have Three Major Thematic Goals We’re Pursuing On The API Client Team And You’ll Be a Key Contributor In Realizing Them
   

  

* Delight the Developer. The developer is central to Postman’s mission. We intend to meet them where they are—faster feedback cycles, GitHub\\-first thinking, and intuitive features that anticipate their needs and respect their time.
* Simplify request sending and debugging. Postman’s power is immense—but we must distill that power into a smooth, low\\-friction experience that makes common tasks effortless and advanced workflows discoverable when needed.
* Build the multi\\-protocol future. Postman isn’t just about REST anymore. We’re investing deeply in modern protocols—GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets—and tying them together into a seamless, end\\-to\\-end experience.


 Behind every fast, reliable API call made in Postman is a constellation of backend systems doing the heavy lifting—executing code, orchestrating local runtimes, syncing data, collecting telemetry, and providing rock\\-solid observability. That’s where you come in.
   

  

**About You**
* Have 8\\+ years of backend engineering experience, with a strong foundation in Node.js and/or Golang.
* Have deep expertise and experience in Kubernetes, Docker, Grafana, and modern CI/CD infrastructure
* Have built, maintained, and scaled distributed systems in production environments.
* Think in systems: you’re passionate about observability, reliability, performance, and ensuring that these are understood by everyone on the team as it relates to our backend systems.
* Can navigate legacy codebases and leave them better than you found them.
* Communicate clearly and effectively especially in async and distributed team settings.
* See beyond your function. You’re not just writing backend code, you’re building a product experience you believe in.


**Nice\\-to\\-Haves**
* Familiarity with distributed tracing tools (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger).
* Knowledge of CRDTs, real\\-time systems, or collaborative libraries and technologies like yjs
* Past experience in developer tools or API platforms.


**Why This Role?**
* The API Client is used by 80% of Postman users—your work directly impacts the daily workflows of millions of developers.
* You’ll shape foundational infrastructure for one of the most loved products in the dev ecosystem.
* You’ll join a world\\-class team that prizes execution, engineering rigor, and solving real user problems—not just shipping code.


 The reasonably estimated base salary for this role ranges from $210,000 to $240,000, plus a competitive equity package. Actual compensation is based on the candidate's skills, qualifications, and experience.
   

  

**What Else?**
 In addition to Postman's pay\\-on\\-performance philosophy, and a flexible schedule working with a fun, collaborative team, Postman offers a comprehensive set of benefits, including full medical coverage, flexible PTO, wellness reimbursement, and a monthly lunch stipend. Along with that, our wellness programs will help you stay in the best of your physical and mental health. Our frequent and fascinating team\\-building events will keep you connected, while our donation\\-matching program can support the causes you care about. We’re building a long\\-term company with an inclusive culture where everyone can be the best version of themselves.
   

  

 At Postman, we embrace a hybrid work model. For all roles based out of San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and New York, employees are expected to come into the office 3\\-days a week. We were thoughtful in our approach which is based on balancing flexibility and collaboration and grounded in feedback from our workforce, leadership team, and peers. The benefits of our hybrid office model will be shared knowledge, brainstorming sessions, communication, and building trust in\\-person that cannot be replicated via zoom.
   

  

**Our Values**
 At Postman, we create with the same curiosity that we see in our users. We value transparency and honest communication about not only successes, but also failures. In our work, we focus on specific goals that add up to a larger vision. Our inclusive work culture ensures that everyone is valued equally as important pieces of our final product. We are dedicated to delivering the best products we can.
   

  

**Equal opportunity**
 Postman is an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer. Qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender perception or identity, national origin, age, marital status, protected veteran status, or disability status. Headhunters and recruitment agencies may not submit resumes/CVs through this website or directly to managers. Postman does not accept unsolicited headhunter and agency resumes.

We’re Jerry.ai. We’re building the first AI\\-powered
 **AllCar™ super app** 
 to make car ownership affordable, seamless, and even magical. From insurance to repairs to road safety, we’re connecting the entire car ownership experience into one mobile\\-first platform. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from
 **5M → 50M** 
 users next.
   

  

 We’re looking for a
 **Full Stack Software Engineer** 
 to join our
 **Growth Team** 
 , building the core systems that help new users onboard, shop for insurance, and complete their transaction seamlessly in our mobile app. This is a rare opportunity to work on the frontline of our core business growth, tackle complex technical and business challenges, and directly impact acquisition, conversion, and retention for millions of users.
   

  

**Why You’ll Love Working Here**
* Real\\-world impact: Your work touches users from the moment they open the app to the moment they purchase a policy. You’ll directly influence onboarding flows, shopping experiences, and automation for Home, Motorcycle, and Car insurance.
* Challenging work: We are refactoring our entire app code. You’ll help tackle tech debt, refactor complex code, and optimize systems across frontend and backend — building the foundations of the next three years of Jerry’s growth platform.
* Zero bureaucracy: Have an idea? Pitch it, implement it, and see it live in days. No red tape, no slow\\-moving processes.
* Brilliant \\+ supportive teammates: Work with talented and kind engineers, product managers, data scientists and designers. Be in an environment that encourages challenging the status quo, innovation, collaboration, and helping each other succeed.
* Flexibility: Work on projects that excite you. Explore new technologies, like AI/LLM tools, early — without bureaucracy slowing you down. Remote\\-friendly and flexible work arrangements allowing you to balance life and work, even internationally.
* Growth \\+ learning: Engineers at Jerry get to take a ton of ownership, swim outside their lanes, level up quickly, and mentor others. Everyone is passionate, involved, and cares intensely about their work and their teammates.


**What You’ll Do**
 We’re adding 2 software engineers to our growth team. Based on your skills, interests, and our team needs, you will work on a combination of the following:
   

  

* Build and maintain systems that power customer onboarding, shopping, and end\\-to\\-end purchase flows for our car, home and motorcycle insurance marketplace products.
* Work on high\\-visibility initiatives, including revamping pre\\-sale flows for new products from scratch.
* Address technical debt, fix inconsistencies and bugs, and contribute to our tech stack refactoring efforts across our end\\-to\\-end shopping flow.
* Support multiple teams and initiatives in parallel while prioritizing the highest\\-impact work for user conversion and revenue.
* Collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and other engineering teams to improve conversion, automation, and the overall user experience.
* Contribute to both frontend (React/React Native) and backend (Node.js, Nest.js), integrating systems across multiple teams.
* Work asynchronously across time zones, participate in daily standups, and maintain strong communication through Asana and Slack.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Experience: At least 1 year experience including internships (SDE I) or at least 2 years experience (SDE II) building production\\-grade software; ideally full stack with some frontend exposure.
* Tech stack: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than having previous experience with specific languages or frameworks.


**Problem solver:** 
 You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.
   

  

* Ownership: You take responsibility for end\\-to\\-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.
* Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously across teams and time zones, with excellent communication skills.
* Curiosity \\+ adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.


**Our Stack**
* Frontend \\& backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo
* API: GraphQL
* Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda

 This isn’t just another coding job — you’ll be
 **solving real\\-world problems at scale** 
 , helping millions of people manage their most expensive (or at least second most expensive) asset more effortlessly. You’ll work in a

 We’re building an AI spreadsheet to automate all knowledge work
 **.** 




 Spreadsheets quietly run every business, forecasts, hiring plans, budgets, ops dashboards. Yet they still rely on hours of manual work: cleaning data, reconciling inputs, building formulas, and answering “can you pull this real quick?”
 



 trufflepig is building an AI spreadsheet that understands what you want and just does it. You describe tasks in plain English; our agent builds, analyzes, and explains results directly inside a familiar sheet.
 



 For the first time in decades, people are willing to churn from Excel and Google Sheets if you save them hours. The interface for that shift is up for grabs. We intend to take it.
 



**Where we are** 




 We launched a month ago, already have paying customers, and hundreds of active users. We’re backed by great investors like Base10 who have invested in companies like Brex, Plaid and Figma.
 



 You'll join as our 4th team member, shaping the product, stack, and culture as we build to help automate all knowledge work.
 



 You'll join a team that includes engineers who shipped production AI and distributed systems at Microsoft and VMware, plus a former management consultant who spent thousands of hours in spreadsheets running finance and ops.
 



  





**What you’ll do** 



* Build AI agents that reason over data, plan, and produce clear, trustworthy outputs.
* Evolve our spreadsheet engine for performance, correctness, and scale.
* Ship UX that lets non\\-technical teams (founders, finance, ops, sales, HR) ask for analysis in plain English and get answers they understand.
* Work across the full stack: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Rust \\+ WASM.
* Prototype fast, test live with users, and productionize what works.



  





**Nice to haves** 



* Have 2\\+ years shipping real, user\\-facing products.
* Move fast across frontend, backend, and AI systems.
* Care about clarity, reliability, and user trust.
* Operate with high agency and ownership.



  





**Why trufflepig** 




 Massive surface area, real users, and an opportunity to redefine the most universal interface in business.
 



 Competitive salary, meaningful ownership, healthcare, and in\\-person collaboration in San Francisco.
