Without the entire team, none of this would be possible.
   

  

**The Role**
 As a Software Engineer Intern at Traversal, you'll help build the core product and AI systems that power our observability platform. Depending on your interests and the team's needs, you might work on:

**You Might Be Good If**
  

  

* You're graduating with a BS/MS in Computer Science or a related field (or have equivalent experience), or you're currently a student looking for an internship.
* You have strong coding skills in Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Rust, or similar, and you've built real projects (internships, research, hackathons, side projects).
* You're interested in one or more of:
+ Full\\-stack development (backend \\+ frontend)
+ AI/LLMs and agents
+ Infrastructure, distributed systems, or data\\-heavy applications

* You enjoy debugging, learning new systems, and working through ambiguous problems.
* You're excited by startups: high ownership, fast iteration, and working closely with a small, senior team.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience with React, TypeScript, Next.js, or other modern frontend frameworks.
* Exposure to backend frameworks (e.g., FastAPI, Flask) or databases like Postgres.
* Projects involving LLMs, prompt engineering, fine\\-tuning, or agentic workflows.
* Familiarity with observability data (logs, metrics, traces) or incident response tools.
* Exposure to cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), Docker, or Kubernetes.
* Contributions to open source or personal projects you're proud to show.


**Compensation**
 We offer competitive compensation for this internship. The hourly rate for this in\\-person role in New York is $40–$60 per hour, depending on experience and interview performance. Interns receive a great tech setup, in\\-office snacks, and access to team events. Eligibility for additional benefits may vary based on internship length and employment classification.
   

  

**Why You Should Join Us**
 We'll make sure you're set up for success with a strong tech setup, hands\\-on mentorship, and plenty of in\\-office snacks. You'll work closely with a small, senior team, ship real features, and see how an AI startup operates from the inside.
   

  

 Traversal is fully in\\-office, 5 days a week, based in New York near Madison Square Park. We have a collaborative, hard\\-working culture and are energized by building the future of AI\\-powered software maintenance.

 At Clarion, we're rebuilding how healthcare communicates in the age of AI. Today, clinics miss 30\\-40% of patient calls while staff drowns in administrative tasks. We believe AI agents should handle these workflows—scheduling, billing, prescription refills—so healthcare teams can focus on actual patient care.
   

  

 We're building the communication infrastructure that modern healthcare desperately needs. Our AI agents don't just answer calls; they complete entire workflows end\\-to\\-end, giving providers back their time and ensuring patients never go unheard. We've already handled hundreds of thousands of patient interactions across virtual care companies, health systems, and a $5B health insurance company.
   

  

 Founded by a Stanford/Harvard\\-trained physician who was on the founding team of Two Chairs and Ophelia, and an ex\\-Amazon Alexa engineer who led AI/ML teams at Salesforce, we uniquely understand both the clinical and technical challenges of transforming healthcare communication.
   

  

**We've raised $5\\.4M from Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia (scout)** 
 , and healthcare founders from Ophelia, Medallion, and Counsel Health. We're an in\\-person team based in New York, moving fast to ensure no patient call goes unanswered.
   

  

****Why Join Us?****

* Technical founding team: You'll work directly with experienced founders who deeply understand both healthcare operations and technical development, enabling faster decision\\-making and better product outcomes.
* Cutting\\-Edge Tech Frontier: You’ll harness the latest generative AI models—LLMs, voice synthesis, and real\\-time transcription—to craft conversational agents that transform healthcare communication, while driving innovation to push these technologies beyond their current limits.
* In\\-person collaboration advantage: We've built in\\-person since day one and maintain this as a strategic advantage—we move faster, build stronger bonds, and create a cohesive culture.


****What you'll be working on****
* Embed with customer teams to deploy and optimize AI agents in live healthcare environments.
* Collaborate with engineering and product teams to customize solutions based on client feedback.

* Contribute to product roadmap by identifying real\\-world challenges faced by customers


**Requirements**

* High agency and ownership: Comfortable in ambiguous situations, making independent decisions, and taking full responsibility for customer success.


****You are a good fit if****
* You build with intensity and excellence—shipping solid code fast, tackling tough problems from start to finish, and holding steady under pressure.
* You take full ownership of your work, acting with high agency in unclear, shifting situations.
* You bring technical passion and a team spirit—driven to solve hard challenges and lifted by working closely with customers and teammates.


****Interesting Technical Challenges****
* Generative AI at Scale: Deploy at\\-scale production systems using generative AI models, tackling safety, alignment, and real\\-time monitoring.
* AI for Healthcare Conversations: Build voice agents that understand medical terminology, navigate complex clinical workflows, and make real\\-time decisions with accuracy comparable to trained medical staff.
* Real\\-time Voice Infrastructure: Create a system that processes speech in milliseconds, handles multiple concurrent calls, and maintains high availability for mission\\-critical healthcare communications.
* Integration with Fragmented Systems: Connect seamlessly with diverse healthcare platforms—from modern cloud APIs to decades\\-old legacy systems—creating a unified communication layer.
* Highly Personalized Experiences: Develop AI that remembers patient preferences, adapts to individual communication styles, and creates natural conversations that feel remarkably human.


****What we offer****
* Transformative impact: Build technology that directly improves healthcare for millions—your code will liberate medical staff from administrative burden and give patients seamless access to care
* Growth trajectory: Join our founding team, grow into leadership, build your team, and shape the technical direction of a rapidly scaling company
* Technical frontier: Work at the bleeding edge of AI and voice technology, solving problems most engineers never get to tackle
* Career opportunity: Position yourself at the convergence of healthcare and conversational AI, building solutions that healthcare organizations desperately need
* Exceptional compensation: Competitive salary, meaningful equity, and comprehensive benefits including 100% covered healthcare, flexible time off, 401(k)


****Interview Process****
 At each stage, we decide within 24hrs and update you shortly after:
   

  

* First Chat (30 min) \\[Virtual]: A casual conversation about the role and your experience to see if there's a good initial fit.
* Technical Assessment (1 hr) \\[Virtual]: Work through a system design exercise with our CTO.
* Team Day (Half\\-day) \\[In\\-Person]: Visit our New York office to meet the team, collaborate on real engineering challenges, and see if we're a good match for each other.

 Rilla builds the world’s leading conversation intelligence software for offline commerce.
   

  

 By recording, analyzing, and indexing conversations, our platform supplies unparalleled alpha to the critical, physical businesses that constitute the backbone of our economy.
   

  

 Our purpose is to bring the technology of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the rest of the economy.
   

  

 As a side effect of this mission, we’ve become one of the fastest growing companies in history. In numbers, that means 0→$40M in 3\\.5 years, growing 15% MoM, Net Revenue Retention above 170%, an NPS higher than the iPhone’s, and profitability.
   

  

 The Role
   

  

 Rilla engineers architect and ship features across the stack at lightning speed. On a daily basis, you will build end\\-to\\-end workflows, take them to production, and solve real world problems across an out\\-sized scale.
   

  

 As an early technical steward, you will raise the bar for code quality and decision‑making, setting patterns that cement a world‑class engineering culture as we scale. While the company 10×’s, your scope and ownership will grow just as fast—building the tools, mental models, and platforms that let both you and Rilla accelerate exponentially.
   

  

 Do you describe yourself as ""obsessive""? Do you aspire to be a founder or a leader in applying AI to the physical world? We believe Rilla is the best place — with the best peers — to learn how.
   

  

 Technologies We Use
   

  

* Different languages and frameworks, including React, React Native, Typescript and Python

 What We Value
   

  

* An infinite learner. Someone who is relentless in their curiosity.
* A customer obsessive. Someone who deeply care about delighting customers and solving real pains, not vanity metrics.
* A winning attitude. You thrive with extreme accountability, learning as a team, and both giving and receiving rapid feedback.
* Extreme empathy. Our customers are not tech companies. They live and work in the real world. Empathy is critical to arriving at correct solutions.
* Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more.


**What We Require**
* Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Javascript, C\\+\\+, Python, Rust, or similar languages.
* Strong engineering prowess, ideally developed at start\\-ups.
* Familiarity with storage and data processing systems, cloud infrastructure, and other technical tools.
* Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to iterate quickly with teammates, incorporating feedback and holding a high bar for quality.


 Don’t Work Here
   

  

**Please Don't Join If You're Not Excited About**
* Building an AI product for an industry untouched by modern software
* Constantly talking to and visiting customers in the field
* Working \\~70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC
* Attempting to build a generational company, and the intensity required to do so


**Compensation**
 The estimated salary range for this position is $200,000 \\- $300,000/year.

 Healthcare should work for patients, but it doesn’t. In their time of need, they call down outdated insurance directories. Then wait on hold. Then wait weeks for the privilege of a visit. Then wait in a room solely designed for waiting. Then wait for a surprise bill. In any other consumer industry, the companies delivering such a poor customer experience would not survive. But in healthcare, patients lack market power. Which means they are expected to accept the unacceptable.
   

  

 Zocdoc’s mission is to give power to the patient. To do that, we’ve built the leading healthcare marketplace that makes it easy to find and book in\\-person or virtual care in all 50 states, across \\+200 specialties and \\+12k insurance plans. By giving patients the ability to see and choose, we give them power. In doing so, we can make healthcare work like every other consumer sector, where businesses compete for customers, not the other way around. In time, this will drive quality up and prices down.

* This is a full\\-time in person role based in our San Francisco or Manhattan offices


**What We Provide**
* Health Insurance: Comprehensive medical, dental \\& vision plans
* Competitive compensation
* Employee Assistance Program
* 401(k)
* FSA \\& HSA savings programs
* Short \\& long\\-term disability

 Amae Health is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices.
   

  

 Base salary range for this role is $115,000 to $155,000 per year based on a full\\-time schedule and the compensation package will include equity. Actual compensation packages are based on several factors that are unique to each candidate's experience and professional leveling and it is not typical for an individual to be hired at or near the top of the range. These factors include, but are not limited to, job related knowledge and skill set, depth of experience, certifications, degrees, licensures, and specific work location.
   

  

**More About Amae**
**'Amae',** 
 pronounced ‘
 **Ah\\-mai’** 
 , is a Japanese concept meaning the need to be in good favor with, and the ability to depend on, the people around oneself. It reflects our core belief that a strong support system is essential to build people up, strengthen their will to carry on and even to thrive in life. This mentality applies across our whole company – from the patients we serve to the team we’re building.
   

  

 We’re a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) that provides outpatient psychiatric and primary care health services through value\\-based care arrangements. Our model’s success is predicated upon achieving outcomes for our patients, not on the volume of services provided.

 Assembled builds the infrastructure that underpins exceptional customer support, empowering companies like CashApp, Etsy, and Robinhood to deliver faster, better service at scale. With solutions for workforce management, BPO collaboration, and AI\\-powered issue resolution, Assembled simplifies the complexities of modern support operations by uniting in\\-house, outsourced, and AI\\-powered agents in a single operating system. Backed by $70M in funding from NEA, Emergence Capital, and Stripe, and driven by a team of experts passionate about problem\\-solving, we’re at the forefront of support operations technology.
   

  

 The Role
   

  

 We’re looking for an experienced software engineer to help shape the foundation of Assembled’s data systems. You’ll join our Data Infrastructure team, a close partner to both our Core Infrastructure and AI Infrastructure teams, to own how data is modeled, stored, and served across the company. This work powers everything from customer\\-facing dashboards to internal analytics and AI\\-driven product features.
   

  

 We're currently rebuilding our metrics infrastructure from the ground up. Our legacy Go\\-based system made it difficult to scale, maintain, and trust the metrics we expose. We’re building a new analytics stack that enables fast, reliable metric queries and simplifies the development of new reports. You’ll be joining at a pivotal moment—early prototypes are in place, and we’re working toward a full\\-scale production rollout and long\\-term migration.
   

  

 The team also plays a central role in the development of Assembled’s AI platform, Assist. As we unify our WFM and AI products into a single Human \\+ AI experience, the Data Infrastructure team is responsible for the analytics that help customers understand how Assist is adopted, how it impacts performance, and where to optimize. You’ll collaborate closely with the Assist team to build robust data models and systems that support this functionality.
   

  

 One of the more unique challenges in this role is that our data infrastructure doesn't just support internal analytics—it powers customer\\-facing product experiences. While some outputs are traditional dashboards, others require near real\\-time responsiveness. As a result, our stack must support both large\\-scale analytical queries and low\\-latency, user\\-triggered interactions—capabilities that most analytics systems are not architected to handle simultaneously. We're building a unified system that can do both, without introducing mismatched data or duplicated definitions.
   

  

**In This Role You'll**
* Design and build systems that power both the storage and retrieval of analytical data
* Own the transformation layer that models data for fast, consistent metric queries
* Define and maintain the metrics layer that supports dashboards, exports, APIs, and internal tools
* Collaborate with product, infrastructure, and Assist teams to build rich reporting experiences—like helping customers measure ROI on AI adoption
* Manage scalable pipelines that move and transform production data for analysis
* Instrument observability into the data platform, including freshness, lineage, and correctness


**You May Be a Good Fit If You**
* Have experience working with modern data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) and understand their performance characteristics
* Have built or maintained end\\-to\\-end ELT pipelines and are comfortable choosing the right level of precomputation
* Have designed or worked closely with a metrics or semantic layer, and understand how to define metrics that are consistent, queryable, and performant across reporting surfaces
* Are comfortable reasoning about systems tradeoffs—latency, cost, developer velocity, and reliability
* Take pride in building systems that are clear, maintainable, and empower others
* Have strong SQL fluency and are comfortable reading query plans, debugging slow queries, and optimizing for performance


**Nice To Have (but Not Required)**

 Rilla builds the world’s leading conversation intelligence software for offline commerce.
   

  

 By recording, analyzing, and indexing conversations, our platform supplies unparalleled alpha to the critical, physical businesses that constitute the backbone of our economy.
   

  

 Our purpose is to bring the technology of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the rest of the economy.
   

  

 As a side effect of this mission, we’ve become one of the fastest growing companies in history. In numbers, that means 0→$40M in 3\\.5 years, growing 15% MoM, Net Revenue Retention above 170%, an NPS higher than the iPhone’s, and profitability.
   

  

 The Role
   

  

 Rilla engineers architect and ship features across the stack at lightning speed. On a daily basis, you will build end\\-to\\-end workflows, take them to production, and solve real world problems across an out\\-sized scale.
   

  

 As an early technical steward, you will raise the bar for code quality and decision‑making, setting patterns that cement a world‑class engineering culture as we scale. While the company 10×’s, your scope and ownership will grow just as fast—building the tools, mental models, and platforms that let both you and Rilla accelerate exponentially.
   

  

 Do you describe yourself as ""obsessive""? Do you aspire to be a founder or a leader in applying AI to the physical world? We believe Rilla is the best place — with the best peers — to learn how.
   

  

 Technologies We Use
   

  

* Different languages and frameworks, including React, React Native, Typescript and Python
* Open\\-source technologies like Node.js, PostgreSQL, Turborepo, Lodash, and Zod

 What We Value
   

  

* An infinite learner. Someone who is relentless in their curiosity.
* A customer obsessive. Someone who deeply care about delighting customers and solving real pains, not vanity metrics.
* A winning attitude. You thrive with extreme accountability, learning as a team, and both giving and receiving rapid feedback.
* Extreme empathy. Our customers are not tech companies. They live and work in the real world. Empathy is critical to arriving at correct solutions.
* Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more.


**What We Require**
* Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Javascript, C\\+\\+, Python, Rust, or similar languages.
* Strong engineering prowess, ideally developed at start\\-ups.
* Familiarity with storage and data processing systems, cloud infrastructure, and other technical tools.
* Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to iterate quickly with teammates, incorporating feedback and holding a high bar for quality.


 Don’t Work Here
   

  

**Please Don't Join If You're Not Excited About**
* Building an AI product for an industry untouched by modern software
* Constantly talking to and visiting customers in the field
* Working \\~70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC
* Attempting to build a generational company, and the intensity required to do so


**Compensation**
 The estimated salary range for this position is $230,000 \\- $300,000/year.
   

  

 Successful candidates with competing offers will receive matching and competitive offers.
   

  

 Total compensation for this position may also include Incentive Stock Options, sign\\-on bonus, and other potential future incentives.

 Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for growth engineers to join our Claude.AI growth team. This key role will help drive user acquisition, engagement, retention, and monetization through data\\-driven strategies and technical implementations. At Anthropic, we're not just building AI tools; we're reimagining how AI can enhance and expand its user base! As a member of the growth team, you will have a unique opportunity to shape our growth strategy. You will work with a cross\\-functional team of engineers, data scientists, marketers, and product managers to design, implement, and optimize growth initiatives that scale our AI\\-powered tools and maximize their impact.
   

  

 Core Responsibilities
   

  

* Develop and implement technical solutions to support user acquisition, activation, retention, and revenue growth
* Design and execute A/B tests and experiments to optimize user onboarding, feature adoption, subscription conversion, and overall product experience
* Collaborate with product and marketing teams to identify growth opportunities and translate them into technical requirements


**You Might Be a Good Fit If You**
* Have 2\\+ years of experience as a software engineer, with experience working on user growth (acquisition, activation, retention) or work on ads or monetization
* Have strong practical coding skills, ideally in full\\-stack development (web and backend), and experience with data analysis and experimentation frameworks
* Take a data\\-driven approach to problem\\-solving, with a keen eye for identifying patterns and opportunities in user behavior and metrics
* Are passionate about the potential of AI to reach and benefit a wide audience, and eager to tackle challenges in scaling AI products
* Thrive in a fast\\-paced, collaborative environment and enjoy working closely with cross\\-functional partners and teammates


**Strong Candidates May Also**
* Have ideas for experiments to run to drive user growth or monetization
* Be able to dive into data and identify opportunities
* Possess a vision for the future of AI product growth and a drive to make that vision a reality


 The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full\\-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.
   

  

**Annual Salary**
 $300,000—$405,000 USD
   

  

**Logistics**
**Education requirements:** 
 We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
   

  

**Location\\-based hybrid policy:** 
 Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
   

  

**Visa sponsorship:** 
 We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
   

  

**We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.** 
 Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
   

  

**How We're Different**
 We believe that the highest\\-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large\\-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long\\-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest\\-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.
   

  

 The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT\\-3, Circuit\\-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI \\& Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
   

  

**Come work with us!**
 Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

 My client is a fast\\-growing AI company developing advanced autonomous systems tailored for complex, high\\-stakes domains like healthcare, legal, and finance. Their core focus is on building AI agents that combine deep technical rigor with human\\-like decision\\-making, enabling organizations to delegate sophisticated workflows with confidence. They’ve built a novel architecture that addresses core challenges around trust and reliability in AI, aiming to make intelligent agents a foundational part of the modern economy.
 



  





  





 The Role \\-
 **Staff Software Engineer, Distributed Systems (Backend Core)** 




 We’re looking for
 **a systems\\-level backend engineer** 
 who builds distributed systems from first principles — not just using frameworks, but designing and implementing the core building blocks that power reliable computation at scale.
 







 You’ll architect and implement the runtime foundation that executes and supervises millions of concurrent AI processes across globally distributed environments.
 



  





 What You’ll Build
 


* Core distributed services handling concurrency, coordination, and state management for their agent runtime.
* Custom messaging, replication, and scheduling mechanisms ensuring consistency and fault tolerance across nodes.
* Low\\-latency data and metadata stores optimized for high\\-throughput transactional workloads.
* Concurrency and synchronization primitives that make distributed execution predictable and safe.
* Observability and recovery mechanisms that provide deterministic replay and forensic auditing of AI decisions.
* Systems for high\\-availability deployment, cluster membership, and leader election without external dependencies.



  





 What We’re Looking For
 


* 5\\+ years of experience
 **building** 
 (not just using) distributed systems, databases, or runtime infrastructure.
* Deep understanding of
 **concurrency, consensus, replication, and durability** 
 — and ability to implement them in code.
* Strong background in
 **C\\+\\+, Rust, or Go** 
 with emphasis on memory management, performance tuning, and correctness.
* Experience designing internal systems like queues, KV stores, schedulers, caching layers, or distributed file systems.
* Comfort working close to the metal (threads, sockets, async I/O, persistence layers).
* Proven ability to reason about
 **consistency models, CAP tradeoffs, and system invariants.**
* Familiarity with observability and debugging of distributed systems in production.
* Curiosity for elegant, minimal designs and an instinct for measuring before optimizing.



  





 Nice to Have
 


* Research or open\\-source contributions in distributed systems (e.g., databases, OS kernels, or storage engines).
* Experience with Raft, Paxos, gRPC internals, or custom RPC frameworks.
* Prior work on systems like Kafka, TiKV, CockroachDB, etc.
* Exposure to regulated or safety\\-critical environments (finance, healthcare, aerospace).","Staffing and Recruiting and Software Development","https://ie.linkedin.com/company/alldus","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQGsOviCV_-dmQ/company-logo_100_100/B4DZX6xzrMHwAU-/0/1743669115985/alldus_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=bFWto1sW9-CoKd0X496adAqnxC8Ttmj88NSRRyqeIUI","","","","","","","","","","",""
