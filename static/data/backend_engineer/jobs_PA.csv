 Blink Health is the fastest growing healthcare technology company that builds products to make prescriptions accessible and affordable to everybody.  Our two primary products – BlinkRx and Quick Save – remove traditional roadblocks within the current prescription supply chain, resulting in better access to critical medications and improved health outcomes for patients. 
 



 BlinkRx is the world’s first pharma\\-to\\-patient cloud that offers a digital concierge service for patients who are prescribed branded medications. Patients benefit from transparent low prices, free home delivery, and world\\-class support on this first\\-of\\-its\\-kind centralized platform. With BlinkRx, never again will a patient show up at the pharmacy only to discover that they can’t afford their medication, their doctor needs to fill out a form for them, or the pharmacy doesn’t have the medication in stock. 
 



 We are a highly collaborative team of builders and operators who invent new ways of working in an industry that historically has resisted innovation. Join us!
 



**About the Role** 


 As a
 **Senior Software Engineer II** 
 at Blink, you’ll take on some of our most critical technical challenges and deliver high\\-impact solutions that shape the future of our products and platforms. You’ll lead the design and execution of initiatives that often span multiple teams, ensuring millions of customers have seamless, affordable access to prescription medications.
 



 You’ll work hands\\-on to build scalable, reliable systems while also influencing technical strategy, mentoring engineers across the team, and partnering closely with product, design, data, and operations to accelerate Blink’s growth.
 



 We believe in pragmatic engineering using trusted tools like AWS, Python, JavaScript, MySQL/Postgres, and Linux. We value simplicity, bias for action, and a deep focus on customer impact. As a Senior Software Engineer II, you’ll be both a builder and a leader raising the bar for technical excellence and helping drive Blink forward.
 



**Role Success** 


 You are an engineer who thrives on solving some of the most complex and meaningful challenges in healthcare. You have a track record of delivering technical solutions that span multiple teams and systems, and you’re excited to build products that give our customers the best possible experience purchasing prescription medications.
 



 We believe in using a small number of well\\-known tools like AWS, Python, Javascript, MySQL, and Linux. We are looking for Senior Engineer II candidates who value simplicity, pragmatism, and impact — engineers who not only write code, but also
 **take on broad ownership, drive cross\\-team initiatives, and mentor others to raise the bar.** 




 Senior Engineers II at Blink take ownership of our hardest, most strategic problems. Your job is to envision and refine solutions that scale across teams, set high standards for engineering excellence, and execute with autonomy and accountability.
 



 You will collaborate closely with talented cross\\-functional teams — designers, product managers, data scientists, marketers, and operators — as well as across multiple engineering groups. Through these partnerships, you’ll shape technical direction, grow our business, and above all, ensure that our customers have access to the least expensive and highest satisfaction pharmacy experience on earth.
 



 At Blink, we determine the specific focus of engineering roles through the interview process. Key potential areas of ownership include: our telemedicine platform; our home delivery experience; our growth systems; our core pharmacy platform; and new product line development. We’ll work with you to find the right fit.
 



**Key Focus Areas:** 




 You’ll own one or more strategic initiatives, which may include:
 


* Our telemedicine platform
* The home delivery experience
* Growth experimentation and personalization
* Core pharmacy infrastructure
* Development of entirely new product lines



**What You’ll Do** 




**Technical Leadership \\& Execution** 



* Design and evolve backend and frontend architecture for scalable, high\\-performance systems
* Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code
* Lead code reviews and promote engineering best practices
* Investigate and resolve complex performance or reliability issues
* Drive the release of new features end\\-to\\-end with testing, documentation, and monitoring



**Team Development \\& Mentorship** 



* Provide technical guidance and coaching to senior and junior engineers
* Help shape our engineering culture by modeling ownership, curiosity, and high standards
* Foster strong cross\\-functional collaboration to ensure alignment between engineering, product, and business



**Innovation \\& Learning** 



* Stay ahead of industry trends, tools, and technologies—and bring them back to the team
* Rapidly prototype, test, and iterate on ideas with a learning mindset
* Champion experimentation and data\\-driven decision making



**Communication \\& Feedback** 



* Communicate complex technical topics clearly to technical and non\\-technical audiences
* Give and receive feedback with empathy and honesty
* Build trust within and across teams to unlock high\\-impact collaboration



**What We Are Looking For** 

* 7\\+ years in a software engineering role, with significant experience driving initiatives that span multiple teams or systems.
* Strong system design and architecture expertise, especially in distributed or large\\-scale platforms.
* Experience owning projects or domains from design through delivery and ongoing evolution.
* Proven ability to mentor other engineers and improve team performance.
* Comfortable influencing technical direction and building consensus among multiple stakeholders.
* Collaborative and communicative — a Class\\-A communicator who simplifies complexity, builds alignment, and drives clarity.
* BA/BS degree in Computer Science or related field; advanced degree preferred but not required.



**Why Join Us:** 




 It is rare to have a company that both deeply impacts its customers and is able to provide its services across a massive population.  At Blink, we have a huge impact on people when they are most vulnerable: at the intersection of their healthcare and finances. We are also the fastest growing healthcare company in the country and are driving that impact across millions of new patients every year.  Our business model not only helps people, but drives economics that allow us to build a generational company. We are a relentlessly learning, constantly curious, and aggressively collaborative cross\\-functional team dedicated to inventing new ways to improve the lives of our customers.

 Here is a note from Andrew Moore to people who are reading these Job Postings:
   

  

 “Hi folks, I’m so glad you are potentially interested in Lovelace AI. This area means a lot to me because while I am an AI optimist, I also think that we technologists owe it to a rightly skeptical world to show that modern intelligent systems can actually be useful. Usefulness comes in many guises: from life sciences to education and from transportation to entertainment and many others. For many of us, security and public safety is also very high on that list. That reasoning leads to this conclusion: I’m determined to make sure that the people building Lovelace AI gain a lot from the experience, including the chance to solve fascinating problems in computer science, AI, business development, customer success and product management. I also hope that we all learn from each other in a highly enriching work environment. But my main hope is that we have a shared sense of accomplishment as we see an increasing number of national security and public safety domains made safer through sensible and robust use of advanced computer science.""","Data Infrastructure and Analytics","https://www.linkedin.com/company/lovelaceai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFHssVmi8UQ1Q/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1699366546407/lovelaceai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=BMV_X5K7hWdcGowszMR-t5zfulE3Wu-nB5iNx1fCKzk","","","","","","","","","","",""
