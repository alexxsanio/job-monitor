 We’re creating an entirely new payments platform, built with stablecoins, to simplify global money movement. Bridge enables faster, cheaper payments and borderless access to dollars via stablecoins. Through our APIs, businesses can send and receive funds across borders faster / cheaper vs. SWIFT and other fiat\\-only rails. Our virtual accounts enable international consumers and businesses to easily access, store and spend US dollars. Our payouts infrastructure enables platforms to disburse USD to anyone globally. We believe many trillions of dollars will move and settle through stablecoin payment rails. Bridge is pulling this future forward.
   

  

 We have a small team of people who have previously built financial infrastructure at some of the world’s leading companies (Coinbase, Stripe, Square, Brex, Upstart, DoorDash, Airbnb) and each and every one of them chose Bridge because they fundamentally believe that stablecoins will be a critical piece of financial infrastructure that allows for the improvement of global money movement.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As an early member of the Bridge engineering team, you will be given the autonomy to work on projects that are truly global in scale and aim to give customers access to products they've never had access to. Many of the use cases that we work on today didn't exist several months ago and that's because our team is dedicated to constant improvement for our partners and end users. Our Engineers have outsized ownership over projects so if you are looking for increased autonomy working on a completely greenfield opportunity, Bridge is the place for you.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Ship software to build out our suite of API products. We’re an engineering and API\\-first company, and you will learn first\\-hand and contribute towards building highly reliable, performant, and mission critical infrastructure serving thousands of developers across the globe.
* Take sole ownership of projects, oftentimes without the support of Product Management, and liaise both internally with teams like Legal/Compliance and externally with our partners and developers.
* Look for constant improvements to our product offerings with the explicit goal of improving the experience for our partners and end users.
* Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation.
* Improve engineering standards, tooling and processes for the team and our broader org.


**Qualifications**
* We are open to hiring engineers at various levels of seniority (SWE through Senior Staff) but at a minimum we are looking for somebody with 5\\+ years of experience.
* Experience building backend systems with SQL databases. Experience with frameworks such as Rails, Django, Express or equivalent is a bonus.
* An enlarged sense of ownership and the ability to lead and influence the design and direction of our products.
* An ability to thrive in a fast paced environment.
* A growth mindset and a constant curiosity and fearlessness to dive into the unknown.
* An ability to write maintainable, well\\-tested, modular code, but also be pragmatic about moving fast.
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to write clear technical documentation.
* Past experience working on crypto or financial products a plus, and while not required, we do look for people who are very passionate about building in this space.
* Experience with building API products a plus, but not required.
* Experience working with blockchain or distributed systems a big plus


 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in\\-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in\\-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
   

  

 Pay and benefits
   

  

 The annual US base salary range for this role is $187,500 \\- $281,300\\. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location.

**About The Role**
 We’re looking for a
 **Full\\-Stack Engineer** 
 with strong
 **backend and DevOps background** 
 to help build and evolve internal tools that power AI research and evaluation. This role sits at the intersection of backend architecture, infrastructure automation, and developer experience — with the larger goal of improving how we measure and ensure the quality and safety of AI systems.You’ll collaborate closely with
 **machine\\-learning researchers, data scientists, PMs, and engineers** 
 , translating complex research workflows into robust, scalable systems. While your primary focus will be on backend services, data models, and infrastructure, you’ll also occasionally contribute to
 **frontend development** 
 to help shape cohesive, user\\-friendly interfaces that bring research workflows to life.
 **What You’ll Work On**
* Designing and implementing backend APIs and data models using modern web frameworks (e.g. Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Node.js / Adonis, or Python / FastAPI)
* Managing MongoDB schemas and performing safe data migrations for live research datasets
* Building and maintaining Dockerized applications and CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes / Argo CD environments
* Maintaining and versioning APIs and SDKs following Semantic Versioning (SemVer), and communicating updates clearly to internal users
* Working directly with internal customers to understand workflows, gather requirements, and translate them into actionable engineering tasks
* Automating developer processes and improving tooling and developer experience across the platform
* Occasionally contributing to frontend development (React or similar frameworks) to integrate new backend features or streamline researcher\\-facing workflows


**What You Bring**
* Strong backend development experience with at least one modern web framework (Laravel, Rails, Node.js / Adonis, or Python / FastAPI)
* Proficiency with Docker and containerized application development
* Experience with MongoDB and schema evolution in production environments
* Familiarity with Kubernetes, Argo CD, or similar DevOps platforms
* Understanding of CI/CD, API versioning, and SDK publishing workflows
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills — comfortable engaging with internal users, clarifying requirements, and turning feedback into practical solutions
* A customer\\-first mindset and enthusiasm for improving internal tooling and developer experience
* A strong work ethic, eagerness to learn new systems and technologies, and the ability to connect disparate tools and architectures into cohesive solutions
* An open, reflective approach — you learn from past experiences without being biased toward past solutions
* Bonus: experience or curiosity in machine\\-learning evaluation, data visualization, Amazon S3, or authentication and security best practices


**Why This Role Matters**
 You’ll help bridge the gap between
 **research and engineering** 
 , enabling teams to evaluate and iterate on AI models more efficiently and responsibly. Your work will directly contribute to improving the
 **quality, reliability, and safety of AI systems** 
 — not by training models, but by building the infrastructure that helps everyone understand them better.This is an opportunity to shape the tools that shape research itself — within a small, collaborative team that values thoughtful design, experimentation, and real\\-world impact.

You’ll work directly with the CEO and Co\\-Founders, partnering on product strategy and owning the full stack of what we build. You’ll also collaborate with a part\\-time Head of Engineering, as well as contract engineers.
   

  

 This role is ideal for someone who is:
   

  

* Deeply AI\\-native (you actively use tools like Claude, Cursor, Replit, Copilot, etc.)
* Comfortable building end\\-to\\-end with modern frameworks (e.g., shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Node.js)
* Excited to rapidly prototype, ship, and iterate
* Entrepreneurial by nature; you have a bias toward action, MVP thinking, high urgency

* Operate with a strong bias toward speed, clarity, simplicity, and ownership.


**ABOUT YOU**
 You might be a great fit if you:
   

  

* Have 5\\+ years of full\\-stack engineering experience and love shipping real production software. Experience building enterprise software is a plus, but not required.
* Are deeply AI\\-first in how you build. You already rely on tools like Claude, Cursor, Copilot, GPT\\-4 to speed development and generate ideas.
* Are fluent with modern front\\-end and full\\-stack frameworks (e.g., shadcn/ui, Next.js or equivalent, Tailwind, Node.js, TypeScript).
* Thrive in early\\-stage environments where priorities shift and you have wide autonomy.
* Operate with a builder’s mindset: fast iterations, pragmatic solutions, and a willingness to prototype and learn.
* Value both speed and quality, and you move fast without creating chaos.
* Care about data security and good engineering hygiene (GDPR, SOC2, secure architecture).

 Data protection needs for large enterprises are evolving into a varied usage of private/public clouds. While Rubrik has built incredibly successful solutions for both, our technical architecture needs to constantly evolve to fit our customers needs, working seamlessly across public/private clouds. To provide the same magical experience to our customers while maintaining the agility of a startup, we need to converge our solutions on a foundation that can be extended \\& re\\-used. This requires continuous rethink across many areas of product and stack.
   

  

 At the heart of Rubrik’s architecture is an open\\-source scalable, distributed SQL database. This is a fundamental building block and the metadata repository for all infrastructure components (e.g. distributed file system) and applications (e.g. Oracle db backup) in Rubrik’s stack. Because of its central role, the performance, scalability, and availability demands from this component are continually increasing.
   

  

 In addition, we are rethinking the APIs \\& interactions of this layer in order to continue building our infra for new and varied use cases for the public \\& private cloud. Being at the core of the stack, this layer (and the team) needs to provide guidance for all software layers above it (e.g., file system, reporting, UI) to transition smoothly.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for a highly motivated and diligent software engineer at the early stage of their software development career with a deep interest in databases and distributed systems or Operating System, Networking, Storage, Clustering, and Containerization with a passion for coding.
   

  

 What you'll do
   

  

* Design \\& Develop: Take end\\-to\\-end ownership of features—from drafting design documents and coding to testing and deployment in production.
* Solve Scale Challenges: Work on complex problems related to data integrity, high\\-throughput systems, concurrency, and security.
* Collaborate: Work closely with Product Managers, UX Designers, and senior engineers through detailed code reviews and architectural discussions.
* Grow \\& Learn: Participate in our structured mentorship program designed to help you rapidly scale your technical skills and navigate your career path.


 Experience you’ll need
   

  

**Qualifications**
* 1\\-2 years of experience
* Experience in programming languages such as Go, Java, Python
* Strong understanding and interest in large\\-scale, distributed systems design and development
* Bachelor’s and/or Master’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Familiarity with current cloud technologies
* Coursework or project experience with Distributed Systems, Networking, File Systems, or Operating System internals.
* Familiarity with Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) or virtualization technologies.
* Experience with using open source software in critical areas.


 The minimum and maximum base salaries for this role are posted below; additionally, the role is eligible for bonus potential, equity and benefits. The range displayed reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire salaries for the role based on U.S. location. Within the range, the salary offered will be determined by work location and additional factors, including job\\-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training.

**About Hoplynk**
 Hoplynk is building the communications and networking layer for the intelligent edge, ensuring resilient connectivity for autonomous systems and mission\\-critical operations in any environment. We’re a pre\\-seed startup spun out of Stanford University and based in San Francisco developing an embedded software/firmware stack that delivers multipath, failure\\-aware networking across heterogeneous links so critical systems stay online when networks don’t.
   

  

**The Role**
 You’ll work on engineering our operator console, bridging our firmware and routing software with a great user experience. Your mission: turn telemetry, network setup, and monitoring into intuitive, no code workflows. You’ll work on building a robust API to enable a seamless flow of telemetry, design intuitive dashboards and analytics platforms, and fine tune Hydra’s copilot. You’ll partner closely with networking, embedded systems, and backend engineers to ship a fast, reliable application.

* Routing/Firmware backend interface: Deploy and maintain a comprehensive backend (REST/gRPC/WebSockets) to consistently pull realtime network health, setup, and data from the embedded device.
* HYDRA copilot: Experiment with and deploy AI enabled features for designing network configurations, answering basic system queries, and managing network health.
* Design system \\& accessibility: Ultimately, good design and ease of use are key to HYDRAs value proposition. With every feature you ship, you’ll ensure the system is truly plug and play and conducive to an end user’s needs. This may involve conversations with customers and key stakeholders.
* Testing and Deployment: contribute UI tests/e2e smoke tests; add observability (front\\-end metrics, logs, etc), and help in building a comprehensive networking test bed for the system..


**What You’ll Bring**
* Experience building and maintaining production\\-scale web applications, ideally using modern frameworks like React or similar component\\-based ecosystems
* Strong fluency in JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and Node.js
* Hands\\-on experience designing real\\-time dashboards, observability or admin tools that surface live data \\- comfortable working with streaming APIs, WebSockets, or adaptive polling strategies for low\\-latency updates.
* Familiarity with caching layers (e.g., Redis, Varnish)

* Rust fluency \\- familiarity with Axum, gRPC, and websockets/SSE
* Strong product sensibility for complex, technical UIs — able to translate ambiguous requirements into intuitive workflows, communicate trade\\-offs, and design low\\-code or configurable interfaces that serve both technical and non\\-technical users.


**Nice to Have**
* Solid grasp of cloud\\-native infrastructure — containerization with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment to AWS.
* Familiarity with advanced data visualization for rendering complex telemetry or analytics data.
* Experience building or integrating real\\-time data pipelines, event\\-driven systems, or messaging (e.g., with Kafka Redis Streams).
* Prior work with observability stacks (OpenTelemetry), and with networking/embedded systems.

* Candor: Say the hard thing kindly, early, and with evidence. Speak up during decisions.
* Humility: Strong opinions, loosely held. Change your mind with facts. Teach and learn in the open; celebrate team wins over heroics.
* Initiative: Run toward the smoke. Own problems end\\-to\\-end. Ship in small, safe steps with clear, observable outcomes.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/hoplynk","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQFRTI3VN7DhlQ/company-logo_100_100/B4DZmCBRQyHsAU-/0/1758822995749/hoplynk_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=NddxHZTRXY5LX91ekUM9MVf0nfBRLlglqmBecV7Tzcs","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.
   

  

 In\\-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in\\-office workdays.
   

  

**About The Role**
 The Monetization team makes it simple and trustworthy for customers to purchase and grow with Notion. Our work spans billing infrastructure, pricing and packaging, AI usage‑based billing, and the experiences that help customers understand what they pay for.
   

  

 We’re looking for an experienced software engineer to be a technical leader on the Monetization team. You’ll focus on the foundations of how Notion charges customers: plans, entitlements, payments, invoices, and AI usage. You will work closely with product, design, finance, data, and go‑to‑market partners to ship changes that are both technically sound and business‑critical.
   

  

 This is a great role if you enjoy hard systems problems (correctness, performance, reliability) and also like seeing your work show up directly in how customers buy and use a product.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Design and evolve the architecture for Notion’s billing and pricing systems so we can launch new plans, add‑ons, and AI usage models without repeated rewrites
* Own end‑to‑end projects that touch multiple systems and teams, from early technical design through rollout and iteration
* Improve the reliability, observability, and correctness of our monetization flows (for example, preventing double‑billing, missed invoices, or quota drift)
* Partner with product and business stakeholders to turn ambiguous monetization ideas into clear technical plans and shipping milestones
* Help other engineers grow by reviewing designs and code, sharing best practices, and setting a high bar for craft on the team


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Significant experience building and operating complex backend systems in production
* Strong skills in system design, data modeling, and working with transactional, correctness‑sensitive domains
* A track record of leading projects that required coordination across multiple teams or stakeholders
* Clear, empathetic communication with both technical and non‑technical partners
* A bias toward simple, robust solutions over clever ones, and comfort working in an evolving product area like pricing and billing


**Nice To Haves**
* Experience with payments, billing, or usage‑based pricing is a plus, but not required—strong engineers who are excited about this space can ramp quickly.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

**About The Role**
 We’re looking for an exceptional Staff Software Engineer who leads from the front. You won't just design systems in a vacuum; you will build them. This is a Player/Coach role: we need someone who can define the technical vision for the organization and then roll up their sleeves to write the reference implementations that set the standard.
   

  

 You will play a pivotal role in our next technological leap: moving our platform from traditional automation toward autonomous AI Agents. You will own technical roadmaps, mentor senior engineers through pair programming, and ship critical code for our most complex features.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Lead by Example (The ""Player"" Aspect)
+ Write Production Code: Spend a significant portion of your time coding. You will take on the most ambiguous and difficult technical challenges, shipping high\\-quality, scalable code that serves as a blueprint for the rest of the team.
+ Prototype \\& Validate: Don’t just document architecture—prove it. Build Proof of Concepts (PoCs) and ""walking skeletons"" to validate technical decisions before broader rollout.
+ Agentic Workflow Development: Lead the engineering effort to integrate LLMs and Agent\\-based architectures into our core product, transitioning manual back\\-office operations into autonomous software workflows.

* Drive Technical Vision (The ""Coach"" Aspect)
+ Architecture with Context: Define multi\\-team architectures that solve real business problems. Ensure our move toward distributed systems and microservices is pragmatic, not just academic.
+ High\\-Impact Mentorship: Mentor Senior Engineers not just through 1:1s, but through code reviews, design pairing, and debugging sessions. Elevate the team’s coding standards by demonstrating what ""great"" looks like.
+ Operational Excellence: Champion org\\-wide quality. If the build is broken or a system is flaky, you jump in to fix it and build the tooling to ensure it doesn't happen again.


**Tech Stack \\& Environment**
* Core: Python (Django/FastAPI), React, TypeScript.
* Data/Infra: PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS, Docker/Kubernetes.
* AI/ML (Emerging): LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic), LangChain/LangGraph, Vector Databases, and Agentic frameworks.


**What You'll Bring**
* The ""Builder"" Mindset: Proven experience as a Staff\\+ engineer who has remained hands\\-on. You are uncomfortable if you go a week without committing code.
* AI/Agent Curiosity or Experience: You have either built production AI features or have deep personal projects involving LLMs and Agents. You understand the challenges of non\\-deterministic outputs and context windows.
* Distributed Systems Expertise: Deep understanding of architectural patterns, but with the pragmatism to know when a monolith is better than microservices.
* Pragmatic Leadership: You can navigate complex organizational problems and build consensus, but you prioritize shipping value over endless debate.
* Full\\-Stack Fluency: While you may lean backend, you understand the entire lifecycle of a request, from the React component to the database query plan.


**What We Offer**
* Hybrid Work Model: Based in San Francisco with a balance of in\\-office and remote flexibility.
* Fresh Lunch: Provided on in\\-office days.
* Commuter Support: $150 monthly reimbursement for transit expenses.
* Health \\& Wellness: $200 quarterly reimbursement to support your well\\-being.
* Time Off: Flexible PTO plus 14 company holidays.
* Comprehensive Coverage: 100% medical, dental, and vision for employees; 75% coverage for dependents.
* Parental Leave: 16 weeks fully paid.
* Retirement \\& Ownership: 401k plan plus an equity package.
* Team Connection: Quarterly virtual events and an annual in\\-person summit.

 At Quintess AI, we’re building AI agents for industrial maintenance teams \\- starting with a voice agent that eliminates tedious admin work, improves data quality, and gives technicians time back to focus on fixing complex assets.
   

  

 We integrate directly with existing enterprise systems to orchestrate maintenance end\\-to\\-end: assigning the right person to the right job at the right time, surfacing critical context, and unlocking faster, smarter repairs.
   

  

 We’re live in the U.S. and Europe, serving major rail operators, and backed by top VCs.
   

  

**The Role**
 We’re looking for an AI Engineer who can move fast, build robust solutions, and work close to customers. As one of our first five engineers, you’ll play a founding role in strengthening our AI stack and delivering delightful real\\-time experiences to enterprise customers.
   

  

 This role combines deep technical work (building real\\-time agentic AI systems) with forward\\-deployed execution (understanding customer needs, adapting flows, prototyping solutions).
   

  

 Responsibilities:
   

  

* Deploy new customers: Build and adapt AI agents for new use cases, often from scratch.
* Build AI features: Design and implement features that solve real customer problems (e.g. RAG\\-powered search integrated into a voice flow).
* Push the stack: Improve our real\\-time voice AI capabilities \\- low\\-latency, robust, and reliable.
* Partner with customers: Engage directly to understand their needs, validate solutions, and iterate quickly.
* Feed the platform: Turn learnings from bespoke builds into reusable blueprints for the core product.


 Required Skills \\& Qualifications:
   

  

 You will be a great fit if you have…
   

  

* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, AI, or related fields.
* Proven experience in machine learning and AI, with a focus on generative models.
* Experience building AI agents (ideally, voice).
* Strong backend engineer (Python, cloud deployment, AI tooling).
* Curious about customer problems; comfortable talking to users and iterating on real workflows.
* Builder mindset: rapid prototyping, creative problem\\-solving, pragmatic execution.
* Excellent problem\\-solving skills and the ability to thrive in fast\\-paced environments.


**Preferred Qualifications**
 You will be amazing if you also have…
   

  

* Experience with real\\-time / low\\-latency AI, voice, or streaming systems.
* Hands\\-on experience orchestrating speech\\-to\\-text, LLM, and text\\-to\\-speech systems into real\\-time flows.
* Knowledge of retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and their implementation.
* Experience integrating AI into enterprise systems (APIs, auth, data pipelines).
* Prior startup / early\\-stage experience with high ownership.


**Why join us?**
 We're going after a massive, overlooked opportunity.
   

  

 Maintenance is one of the last labor\\-intensive industries untouched by modern software and AI. Outdated, manual processes cost billions each year in wasted resources, downtime, and lost expertise.
   

  

 We’re building the AI agent layer that modernizes this industry \\- and our first customers are already live in the U.S. and Europe.
   

  

* We are funded: backed by Silicon Valley VCs
* Big Impact: our voice agent is already changing how technicians work, and the potential value is huge \\- from saving hundreds of hours of admin per site today, to unlocking multi\\-million dollar efficiency gains as we expand into full workflow automation.
* Strong Technical Foundation: built by engineers who know the operational pain and how to move from MVP to scale


 In short:
   

  

* Founding engineer level impact (first 5 engineers)
* Heavy exposure to cutting\\-edge AI (LLMs, real\\-time voice agents)
* Real\\-world problems, not just demos
* Early equity upside
* Work directly with the CTO and CEO

 We're building the world's first viral agent. An AI purpose built for influencer marketing.
   

  

 Not a tool. Not a platform. An autonomous agent that goes from ""I need this campaign to break"" to ""50 influencers live next week"" with minimal human intervention.
   

  

**Why this matters:** 
 We have 3 years of proprietary data on what makes influencer content go viral. Warner, Sony, and Universal trust us to break their biggest artists. We're backed by the biggest names in entertainment including Sofia Vergara, Karol G, Tommy Mottola, and Tier 1 VCs like Point72 Ventures. We're not building for hypothetical use cases. We're shipping production AI that drives millions in revenue today.
   

  

**Why we'll win:** 
 We have what no one else has: both the data and the distribution. We have proprietary data on thousands of influencers and what makes content go viral, plus direct relationships with the influencers themselves. In the AI era, having both is the moat. Everyone else has one or the other. We have both.
   

  

**Why now:** 
 AGI agents will replace middle level work by 2027\\. We have a 12 to 18 month window before the market floods with agents. We're building the category defining social media viral agent right now.
   

  

**What we're looking for:** 
 Young talent ready to go all in. We're offering significant equity to people who want to build something that matters. This isn't a job. It's an opportunity to define the future of AI in influencer marketing and own a meaningful piece of it.
   

  

**Your Skillset**
* Expertise in mobile development (Flutter)
* Expertise in full\\-stack development (Node.js, Next.js) and scalable systems
* Experience developing and maintaining APIs
* Hands\\-on experience with AI tools and agents (e.g., Cursor, embeddings, LLMs)
* Strong grasp of API architecture, performance tuning, and database optimization (SQL)
* Technical leadership and ownership: from design to deployment
* Deep code quality standards: automation, testing, reviews, and focus on end\\-to\\-end ownership
* Effective communicator across product, design, and business
* Familiarity with cloud infra (AWS/GCP) and container tools (Docker, Kubernetes)


**You’re The Type Who**
* Brings a generalist mindset — versatile, hands\\-on, and comfortable across the stack
* Moves fast, builds with precision, and expects high standards
* Thrives in early\\-stage startups where nothing is “someone else’s job”
* Sees ambiguity as an opportunity to lead
* Is obsessed with pushing what’s possible with AI and scalable systems


 What We Offer
   

  

  

* Competitive equity in a venture\\-backed company shaping the future of music influencer marketing
* A seat at the table as we update and develop our AI Agent to power smarter matchmaking and campaign automation
* Access to elite tools, AI copilots, and a team that builds daily at top speed
* Hybrid flexibility \\+ top\\-tier health benefits
* The opportunity to shape the foundation of Influur’s AI systems that empower creators and brands globally


 We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses.

Here’s what they said.**
 At most companies, engineers wait.
   

  

 Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.
   

  

 At Jerry.ai, we don’t wait.
   

  

 If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it — sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us:
 ***“At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.”***
 That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you’ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior — sometimes the same week they ship.
 ***“Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,”***
 said another.
 ***“And things move fast.”***
 We don’t do bureaucracy. We don’t do politics. Everyone here — from our CTO to our tech leads — writes code and sweats the details.
 ***“The leaders here lead by example,”***
 one teammate shared.
 ***“They have very high standards. They don’t settle for just OK.”***
 It’s challenging work, but it’s meaningful. You’ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You’ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly:
 ***“I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.”***
 We’re a remote\\-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.
   

  

**So, what is** 
**Jerry.ai** 
**and why should you care?🤔**
 Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you’ll ever own — and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we’re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we’re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion\\+ problem and we’re the only company tackling it end\\-to\\-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next.
   

  

**What You’ll Work On**
 We’re adding 2 software engineers to our growth team. Based on your skills, interests, and our team needs, you will work on a combination of the following:
   

  

* Build and maintain systems that power customer onboarding, shopping, and end\\-to\\-end purchase flows for our car, home and motorcycle insurance marketplace products.
* Work on high\\-visibility initiatives, including revamping pre\\-sale flows for new products from scratch.
* Address technical debt, fix inconsistencies and bugs, and contribute to our tech stack refactoring efforts across our end\\-to\\-end shopping flow.
* Support multiple teams and initiatives in parallel while prioritizing the highest\\-impact work for user conversion and revenue.
* Collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and other engineering teams to improve conversion, automation, and the overall user experience.
* Contribute to both frontend (React/React Native) and backend (Node.js, Nest.js), integrating systems across multiple teams.
* Work asynchronously across time zones, participate in daily standups, and maintain strong communication through Asana and Slack.


**Our Tech Stack**
* Frontend \\& backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo
* API: GraphQL
* Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda
* Our business has grown more complex over time. We’re refactoring major parts of our app — simplifying old systems, rebuilding core flows, and setting up the next three years of our platform’s growth. You’ll help build the foundation for that next phase.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Experience: At least 1 year (including internships) for SDE I, or 3\\+ years for SDE II, building production\\-grade software, ideally full stack with some frontend exposure.
* Technical strength: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than prior experience with our tech stack.
* Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.
* Ownership: You take responsibility for end\\-to\\-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.
* Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills.
* Curiosity \\+ adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.


 This isn’t another coding job.
 **You’ll work in a flexible** 
 , fast\\-moving, and
 **highly** 
**collaborative** 
**culture** 
 , where
 **innovation** 
**is** 
**encouraged** 
 ,
 **your voice is heard** 
 , and the
 **impact of your work is immediate** 
 . You’ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn, and grow alongside talented peers.
