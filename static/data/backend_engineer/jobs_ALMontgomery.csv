* Collaborate with retrieval engineers to ensure ingested data is optimized for indexing and retrieval performance (sharding, metadata enrichment, incremental updates).
* Establish SLAs and monitoring for ingestion throughput, latency, data completeness, and recovery.
* Partner with platform, security, and compliance teams to ensure ingestion pipelines handle sensitive legal data securely and meet enterprise standards.
* Champion best practices in CI/CD, observability, automated testing, and operational readiness for ingestion systems.
* Contribute to innovation by incorporating vector indexing, knowledge graph enrichment, and AI\\-driven pipelines into the ingestion workflow.


**Required Skills And Experience**
* 6\\+ years of professional software engineering experience, including 2\\+ years in a lead role.
* Proven expertise in building distributed ingestion or ETL systems for search or largescale data platforms.
* Deep knowledge of indexing/search systems (Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr, Vespa, or OpenSearch).
* Strong programming skills in C\\#, Java, Python, or Go, with emphasis on reliability and performance.
* Familiarity with schema evolution, metadata modeling, and handling semi/unstructured data for indexing.
* Hands\\-on experience with Kubernetes, containerization, and CI/CD pipelines in cloud environments (Azure, AWS, or GCP).
* Strong background in observability and operational resilience for ingestion systems.


**Desirable Skills And Experience**
* Experience integrating embeddings and vector databases into ingestion workflows.
* Familiarity with knowledge graph enrichment for entity and relationship extraction during ingestion.
* Background in compliance\\-heavy domains such as legal, finance, or healthcare.
* Experience with change data capture (CDC) and event sourcing patterns.
* Contributions to open\\-source ingestion, indexing, or retrieval frameworks.


**Why Join Us?**
* Lead the Retrieval Ingestion Team, driving how documents flow into Relativity’s next generation search platform.
* Operate at the core of retrieval, distributed systems, and AI, ensuring billions of documents are indexed securely and efficiently.
* Mentor engineers and shape best practices for ingestion and indexing across the organization.
* Join a cloud\\-native engineering culture investing in scalable, AI\\-enabled retrieval systems that transform how legal data is discovered.
