Inspired by a legacy of innovating for the benefit of others, our mission is to challenge the current state of mobility through human\\-centric innovation — expanding what “mobility” means and how it serves society.
   

  

 Our work centers on four pillars: AD/ADAS, our autonomous driving and advanced driver assist technologies; Arene, our software development platform for software\\-defined vehicles; Woven City, a test course for mobility; and Cloud \\& AI, the digital infrastructure powering our collaborative foundation. Business\\-critical functions empower these teams to execute, and together, we’re working toward one bold goal: a world with zero accidents and enhanced well\\-being for all.
   

  

**Team**
 Our data platform team is working on accelerating autonomous driving by providing access to petabytes of data collected by our fleet of autonomous and non\\-autonomous vehicles. Efficient, fast and cost\\-effective access to data at large scale is key to tackle the hardest problems in AD/ADAS, from developing the Machine Learning (ML) models for perception and prediction of human driving patterns, to increasing the sophistication of our validation and simulation by identifying rare and interesting real\\-world driving situations. The data ecosystem developed by the AD/ADAS data team is a key building block for developing and testing modern AD/ADAS products that will impact millions of customers. Our data collection, tracking, processing, and visualizations are built on top of modern, industry\\-standard technology cloud services.
