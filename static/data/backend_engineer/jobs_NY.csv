 Norm Ai, the leading Legal \\& Compliance AI company, has a client base with a combined $30 trillion in assets under management. By turning legal code into AI code, Norm enables enterprises to move faster and more comprehensively in their legal and compliance processes with auditability, reliability, and trust.
   

  

 Norm’s platform combines frontier AI, proprietary legal reasoning systems, and embedded legal and regulatory expertise.
   

  

 Norm Ai has raised more than $100 million, backed by Blackstone, Bain Capital, Vanguard, Citi, New York Life, TIAA, Coatue, Craft Ventures, and Marc Benioff.
   

  

 Norm Ai pioneered Legal Engineering, the process that empowers lawyers to build and supervise domain\\-specific AI agents with Norm’s proprietary suite of no\\-code software tools. Norm hired dozens of lawyers from premier U.S. law firms and trained them as Legal Engineers, who specialize in breaking down legal workflows into units of analysis targeted enough to reliably leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning. The granular LLM outputs that constitute a given workflow are orchestrated in a logically structured and human interpretable manner and rigorously validated against data and expertise. The resulting dynamic systems can complete the first pass of the legal workflow and provide detailed explanations.
   

  

 We also developed the first Domain Specific Language (DSL) for fully representing regulatory requirements in AI code. This DSL, deployed with our enterprise platform, enables Norm clients to transform workflows and apply compliance checks at the source of business activities.

**Description \\& Requirements**
 Our group:
   

  

 The Bloomberg Query Language (BQL) standardizes how data is accessed across the company. The BQL and Semantic Platform organization develops and maintains BQL along with the semantic infrastructure that models and manages the data and metadata behind it.
   

  

 Our goal is to build the Bloomberg Knowledge Graph, which will power the next generation of Bloomberg applications. To achieve this goal, we provide tools for model creation and metadata management, the infrastructure for ingesting, validating, inferring, and storing the well\\-structured data, as well as providing the APIs that enable seamless access to it.
   

  

**Our Team**
 As part of a large initiative to organize our data using Semantic Technologies at Bloomberg, we are developing a triplestore, a type of graph database. The general idea behind Semantic Technologies is that all data can be modeled, serialized, and (logically) linked into a large Knowledge Graph, which can then be queried to answer questions like “How is my portfolio affected by the recent election results in Turkey?”.
   

  

 The database will be used to store our semantic models and select datasets that are used by various engineering teams within the company. The team will be responsible for ensuring that information is correctly stored and made queryable on a highly available system with optimal runtime characteristics and reliability expected from any enterprise grade database.
   

  

**Our Tech Stack**
 RDF4J, LMDB/RocksDB, Postgres, Java, Python, SPARQL, SHACL, Inferencers, R2RML, RDF
   

  

**You’ll Need To Have**
* 4\\+ years of professional software development experience
* A Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, similar field of study or equivalent work experience
* Expertise in Database Internals (e.g. You've developed a replicated database and not just a user of one)


**We’d Love To See**
* Experience with Eclipse RDF4J, Apache Jena, and/or Triplestores
* Experience with LMDB and/or RocksDB


 Salary Range \\= 160000 \\- 240000 USD Annually \\+ Benefits \\+ Bonus
   

  

 The referenced salary range is based on the Company's good faith belief at the time of posting. Actual compensation may vary based on factors such as geographic location, work experience, market conditions, education/training and skill level.
   

  

 We offer one of the most comprehensive and generous benefits plans available and offer a range of total rewards that may include merit increases, incentive compensation (exempt roles only), paid holidays, paid time off, medical, dental, vision, short and long term disability benefits, 401(k) \\+match, life insurance, and various wellness programs, among others. The Company does not provide benefits directly to contingent workers/contractors and interns.

 Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for growth engineers to join our Claude.AI growth team. This key role will help drive user acquisition, engagement, retention, and monetization through data\\-driven strategies and technical implementations. At Anthropic, we're not just building AI tools; we're reimagining how AI can enhance and expand its user base! As a member of the growth team, you will have a unique opportunity to shape our growth strategy. You will work with a cross\\-functional team of engineers, data scientists, marketers, and product managers to design, implement, and optimize growth initiatives that scale our AI\\-powered tools and maximize their impact.
   

  

 Core Responsibilities
   

  

* Develop and implement technical solutions to support user acquisition, activation, retention, and revenue growth
* Design and execute A/B tests and experiments to optimize user onboarding, feature adoption, subscription conversion, and overall product experience
* Collaborate with product and marketing teams to identify growth opportunities and translate them into technical requirements


**You Might Be a Good Fit If You**
* Have 2\\+ years of experience as a software engineer, with experience working on user growth (acquisition, activation, retention) or work on ads or monetization
* Have strong practical coding skills, ideally in full\\-stack development (web and backend), and experience with data analysis and experimentation frameworks
* Take a data\\-driven approach to problem\\-solving, with a keen eye for identifying patterns and opportunities in user behavior and metrics
* Are passionate about the potential of AI to reach and benefit a wide audience, and eager to tackle challenges in scaling AI products
* Thrive in a fast\\-paced, collaborative environment and enjoy working closely with cross\\-functional partners and teammates


**Strong Candidates May Also**
* Have ideas for experiments to run to drive user growth or monetization
* Be able to dive into data and identify opportunities
* Possess a vision for the future of AI product growth and a drive to make that vision a reality


 The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full\\-time employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.
   

  

**Annual Salary**
 $300,000—$405,000 USD
   

  

**Logistics**
**Education requirements:** 
 We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
   

  

**Location\\-based hybrid policy:** 
 Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
   

  

**Visa sponsorship:** 
 We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
   

  

**We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.** 
 Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
   

  

**How We're Different**
 We believe that the highest\\-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large\\-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long\\-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest\\-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.
   

  

 The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT\\-3, Circuit\\-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI \\& Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
   

  

**Come work with us!**
 Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

 Orchard is radically simplifying the way people buy and sell their homes. For the average American, the home purchase and sale process takes months, creates anxiety, and is filled with uncertainty and hassle. Orchard has reimagined the end\\-to\\-end experience of buying and selling, from innovative home search tools to find the perfect home to the ability to buy a new home before selling your current one. Orchard customers manage the entire experience through a personalized online dashboard, while also getting the support of best\\-in\\-class Orchard real estate agents.
   

  

 Headquartered in New York City with teammates across the US, Orchard has 150\\+ employees. We have financing from top\\-tier investors including Revolution, Firstmark, Accomplice, Navitas and Juxtapose, who have also backed the likes of Pinterest, Airbnb, Shopify and Sweetgreen. We're proud to be recognized by Crain's, Inc. 5000, Glassdoor, Parity.org and Built In on their lists of best places to work.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Orchard’s engineering team values clarity, collaboration, and ownership. Our Consumer team builds the systems behind Orchard’s website and the tools that help agents reach new customers. We focus on helping people explore homes, book consultations, and connect with our agents.
   

  

 Our site serves over 150k unique visitors each month and sees about 700k pageviews. The team partners closely with marketing, product, and design to support new campaigns, track performance, and ensure the site is fast and reliable at scale.
   

  

 You’ll work on the backend systems that make this possible. That means building and improving APIs, data services, and integrations that support both customers and agents. Your work will touch many parts of the systems our team owns. We build and maintain the services that bring new customers into Orchard, from the public website and intake flows, to scheduling and consultation booking. We also support the tools that help our agents work with those customers, like managing and syncing leads, powering outreach, and maintaining privacy and consent systems that keep customer data safe and compliant.
   

  

 You’ll work closely with product managers, designers, engineers, and business stakeholders to plan and ship projects. The team is small and moves quickly, so you’ll have real ownership and visibility in your work. We use AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude in our daily work, and look for engineers who are curious about how these tools can make development faster and more effective.
   

  

 This is a full\\-time hybrid role based in our New York office (2 days per week).
   

  

**What You'll Do Here**
* Build and maintain APIs and backend services that power Orchard’s website and internal tools. Most of our stack uses Qwik on the frontend and Python with Postgres and OpenSearch on the backend, though some other services use Angular and Go.
* Work with product and design to turn ideas into clear, well\\-scoped projects.
* Debug and improve core services to make them faster and more reliable as we prepare for national growth over the next 12\\-18 months.
* Ensure our systems can scale smoothly as our user base continues to grow.
* Write clean, tested code that’s easy to understand and maintain.
* Help improve developer workflows, testing, and documentation.
* Take part in on\\-call rotations and own the systems you build.
* Work with a small team that values communication, trust, and practical solutions.


**We'd Love to Hear From You if You Have**
* At least 3 years of experience as a software engineer focused on backend development.
* Strong skills in Python or other backend languages, with solid knowledge of APIs and databases.
* Experience with tools like AWS, Postgres, SQL, Kafka, Airflow, Docker, or CircleCI is a plus.
* Strong debugging and testing habits, and experience working in shared codebases.
* Regularly use AI tools like Copilot, Cursor, or Claude \\- or are genuinely curious and eager to learn how to use them effectively.
* A low\\-ego, problem\\-solving mindset. You take ownership and improve what you touch.
* Interest in a hands\\-on team where engineers ship quickly and have real impact.


*For NYC residents only: The pay range for this position in New York City is $130,000\\-$150,000/year. The actual base pay offered may vary within the range provided depending on job\\-related knowledge, skills, experience, and location.

**Eagle** 
 is an AI holding company with a simple mission: bolster American resilience by creating the next\\-gen engineering services firm.
   

  

 Today American infrastructure faces no shortage of challenges — from natural disaster risk and climate change to outright age and deterioration.
   

  

 The problem is that the way we design infrastructure is stuck in the past.
   

  

 Engineers today spend most of their time bogged down in documentation, clunky CAD software, and manual workflows — acting more like back\\-office admin than inventive builders.
   

  

 We’re on a mission to change that.
   

  

 We’re acquiring and partnering with the best engineering design firms — civil, structural, environmental, MEP, and more — to embed AI at the core of their operations and create the engineering firm of the future.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a
 **Software Engineer** 
 at Eagle, you’ll play a pivotal role in shaping the future of AI\\-powered engineering services. You’ll work across the stack to build intuitive, high\\-impact products that blend human expertise with autonomous AI agents, transforming how infrastructure is designed. This is an opportunity to join an early\\-stage team, have meaningful product ownership, and help define the engineering culture as we scale.
   

  

**What You Will Do:**
* Design, build, and maintain scalable backend systems that power AI\\-driven automation.
* Develop APIs and services that integrate AI models into customer\\-facing applications.
* Collaborate with AI and frontend engineers to integrate our AI\\-powered platform into customer\\-facing tools.
* Drive technical decisions around system architecture, scalability, and best practices as we scale.
* Ship fast and iterate, balancing speed with quality in a fast\\-paced, startup environment.


**Who You Are:**
* 4\\+ years of software engineering experience, with expertise in building and scaling web services.
* Strong proficiency in Python, Node.js, or Go, with experience in cloud\\-based architectures (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
* Familiarity with AI/ML\\-driven systems or real\\-time data processing is a plus.
* User\\-focused builder \\- you care deeply about the customer experience and sweat the details.
* Startup mindset \\- comfortable with ambiguity, eager to take ownership, and ship quickly.
* Bonus: Experience integrating LLMs, AI\\-powered automation, or observability tools is a plus, but not required.

**About The Company**
 We repressent a company building an AI platform that serves as a Watchtower for global supply chains. They are beginning with one of the most critical and complex networks in the world: the global food supply chain that moves food from farm to table. In just a short period, they have gone from concept to product, onboarded early customers, and are already automating more than $10 million in monthly orders with no human involvement. Their technology is helping businesses save millions in payroll while increasing net profits by up to 20 percent within weeks of going live.
   

  

 After securing $3\\.8 million in funding from leading investors, they are now expanding its founding team. They are looking for elite, ambitious builders to help scale from their strong foothold in food distribution to broader enterprise deployments across the full supply chain landscape, including freight, manufacturing, and distribution.
   

  

 They are helping its customers modernize operations and move beyond outdated ERP systems into the era of AI. Their intelligent agents do more than sit on top of legacy platforms like SAP or NetSuite—they actively help run the business. What Salesforce did for CRM, this team is doing for the entire supply chain stack. The global food supply chain alone represents a $10 trillion opportunity, and for them, that is only the beginning.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for a Founding Full Stack Engineer to help build the next generation of AI\\-driven systems for global supply chains, starting with the food industry. You will work side by side with the founders to architect, develop, and deploy intelligent agents that automate real\\-world business processes end to end.
   

  

 As one of the first four people on the team, you will be deeply involved in shaping both the product and the culture. This is a role for someone who thrives in fast\\-paced, high\\-intensity environments, takes ownership of everything they build, and sees engineering as a craft. You will be working in person with the founders, iterating rapidly, and shipping code that directly impacts customers’ operations.
   

  

 This is not a typical startup job. You will be part of a small team that lives and breathes its mission. You will work hard, push boundaries, and be surrounded by people who do the same. The expectation is full commitment, high accountability, and no tolerance for mediocrity. The opportunity is to grow into a key builder of a product that could redefine an entire industry.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Build and scale agentic systems that automate complex workflows across ERP and supply chain environments
* Fine\\-tune small language models for specific use cases such as order management, credit control, and procurement
* Develop and maintain full stack applications using modern frameworks like Next.js and Python
* Collaborate directly with founders to translate customer pain points into technical solutions
* Join onsite onboarding sessions with clients to understand real\\-world processes and refine product performance
* Drive projects from concept to deployment with full ownership over architecture, implementation, and optimization


**Requirements**
* 2 to 5 years of experience in high\\-growth environments (Seed to Series B or equivalent)
* Mastery of Python and core data science libraries
* Strong experience with Next.js and AWS
* Understanding of LLM orchestration, agent frameworks, and workflow automation
* Ability to move quickly, learn continuously, and operate across the stack
* Experience in AI model development or small model fine\\-tuning is a strong plus
* Comfort working closely with non\\-technical users and turning real\\-world problems into elegant technical solutions


**The Type Of Person Who Will Succeed Here**
* Builder mentality with a founder\\-like sense of ownership
* High personal standards and a relentless drive to improve
* Competitive nature and bias toward action
* Exceptional curiosity about how systems, people, and industries work
* Strong emotional intelligence and humility
* Proven ability to thrive in intense, hands\\-on, startup environments
* Genuine motivation to make an impact beyond code

 Monzo Group is a leading financial technology company, with over 13 million customers in the UK, committed to providing modern banking solutions. In the last few years, we’ve built a banking app that our customers love – with extremely high daily engagement, an industry leading net promoter score, and award\\-winning customer support. We’ve raised over $1 billion from Capital G, Google’s growth fund, Ribbit Capital, TenCent, YCombinator, Stripe, Coatue, and others \\- most recently at a $5\\.9 billion valuation in 2024\\.
   

  

 We’re just getting started in the US. We’re an agile full stack team operating like an early stage startup but with the financial, operational, and engineering platform muscle of a larger company. We’re focused on building an amazing US product, shipping and iterating quickly, and deepening our product market fit. We’re looking for highly driven, enterprising people to help us achieve our mission to make money work for everyone.
   

  

**About Our Engineering Team**
 We are a team of 20 engineers working in a startup environment and on a mission to make digital banking work for everyone in the US. We have big ambitions for the future, and technology plays a big role in creating a bank our customers want. Engineers at Monzo collaborate across disciplines to solve interesting challenges throughout the company.
   

  

 These range from the products our customers use everyday to underlying infrastructure, security, payments and finance, customer operations, financial crime, and data, to name just a few areas. There is scope for impact across a huge number of opportunities.
   

  

**Your day\\-to\\-day**
 This role is all about collaborating with your team to make a difference to your customers. As a backend engineer you’ll work in a squad alongside other disciplines like product managers, marketers, user researchers, designers, mobile engineers, web engineers, data analysts, business analysts, writers and more!
   

  

 Together you’ll build the Monzo US application. You’ll work with squads across
 *collectives* 
 (a word we use to describe self\\-governing business units of \\~100 people).
   

  

 We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements, our backend engineers have a variety of different backgrounds. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we’d love to talk to you.
   

  

**How We Work 💻**

 Our offices are naturally social, especially Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Teams also schedule time together often for work and play – in or around the office, or online.
   

  

**Set up a work schedule that delivers impact and fits your life.**
 At Monzo, we value connections, flexibility, and wellbeing. We keep our meetings during core hours to stay connected and believe in maintaining work/life balance.
   

  

 You’ll be empowered to manage your work in a way that suits you and your team, giving you the freedom for children drop\\-offs and pick\\-ups, walking your dog or adventurous cat, avoiding peak commuting times or gym slots, appointments, or supporting your family in an emergency. 🕒✨

 Millions of people across the country are navigating mental health conditions, substance use disorders, and eating disorders, but too often, they’re met with barriers to care. From limited local options and long wait times to treatment that lacks personalization, behavioral healthcare can leave people feeling unseen and unsupported.
 



  





 Charlie Health exists to change that. Our mission is to connect the world to life\\-saving behavioral health treatment. We deliver personalized, virtual care rooted in connection—between clients and clinicians, care teams, loved ones, and the communities that support them. By focusing on people with complex needs, we’re expanding access to meaningful care and driving better outcomes from the comfort of home.
 



  





 As a rapidly growing organization, we're reaching more communities every day and building a team that’s redefining what behavioral health treatment can look like. If you're ready to use your skills to drive lasting change and help more people access the care they deserve, we’d love to meet you.
 



  





**About the Role** 




 Charlie Health leads the nation in high\\-acuity virtual behavioral care, having delivered life\\-saving treatment to more than 100,000 clients nationwide. Our Therapist Success team builds the platform that powers the care itself, helping therapists deliver consistent, high\\-quality treatment every day.
 



  





 You’ll create tools that give our therapists the right information at the right time. From organizing a client’s full care history to surfacing dynamic summaries and playbooks for each session, your work will help clinicians prepare, document, and make better decisions in real time. The systems you build will bring structure to complex clinical data, strengthen quality across our network, and ultimately make our care more effective.
 



  





 If you care about building tools that empower therapists to focus on care, not clicks, this is the team for you.
 



  





**Responsibilities** 



* Develop and deliver high quality, performant, maintainable features that drive meaningful business value using our core technology stack: React, Python, and PostgreSQL.
* Partner with teammates across the organization to understand our business. Leverage that understanding to drive data modeling discussions and decisions.
* Be an owner. Collaborate with product and design to iterate to top notch product solutions.
* Identify bottlenecks and implement improvements to engineering processes, tools, and procedures. We’re early and the expectation of folks joining at this stage is that you’ll play a huge part in setting and improving how we work.
* Promote a culture of collaboration and learning across engineering, product, and design team via mentoring, documentation, presentations, or other knowledge sharing methods.
* Ensure our clients can always access the care they need by participating in our on\\-call rotation



  





**Requirements**

"li-4308616365","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4308616365","","Staff Software Engineer, Square Cards","Square","New York, NY","2025-11-12","fulltime","description","yearly",263600.0,395400.0,"USD",True,"mid-senior level","Engineering and Information Technology","","privacy@block.xyz","Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn't work together.
   

  

 So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we've embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.
   

  

 Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We're building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.
   

  

 The Role
   

  

 Square helps business owners access, manage, and grow their money. The Square Debit Card is at the center of that experience — a business card sellers use every day to pay vendors, manage cash flow, and reinvest in their business. The Cards team owns the entire cardholder journey, from activation and digital wallet integration to spend incentives and rewards. We're building systems that help sellers trust Square with more of their financial lives.
   

  

 We're looking for a Staff Product Engineer to shape the next generation of our card experience. You'll lead technical strategy for how we personalize and optimize key seller moments — using data, experimentation, and ML to help sellers get value from Square faster and keep them engaged longer. This is a hands\\-on, cross\\-functional role: you'll work closely with PMs, data scientists, and ML engineers to build, measure, and iterate on new product hypotheses at scale.
   

  

 You Will
   

  

* Lead design and development of systems that drive seller engagement through incentives, onboarding, and spend experiences.
* Build and scale experimentation frameworks for testing offers, activation flows, and cardholder behaviors across millions of users.
* Partner with ML teams to integrate models that predict engagement and personalize incentives, rewards, or educational nudges.
* Develop infrastructure and pipelines that enable fast iteration and statistically sound decision\\-making.
* Collaborate with design, product, and analytics to translate insights into production features that improve retention and satisfaction.
* Mentor engineers across teams, raising the bar for experimentation quality, observability, and data\\-driven development.
* Set technical direction for how the Cards team measures, learns, and ships product changes efficiently and responsibly.


 You Have
   

  

* 12\\+ years of engineering experience, including deep work in product\\-facing or ML\\-enabled systems.
* A strong background in backend or full\\-stack development using languages like Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Go, or Python.
* Experience building large\\-scale experimentation or personalization systems (A/B testing, feature flagging, model integration).
* Familiarity with modern ML workflows — e.g., training/inference pipelines, feature stores, or real\\-time scoring — and how to integrate them safely into production systems.
* A track record of influencing product direction through data and experimentation, not just intuition.
* Strong collaboration and communication skills; able to bridge engineering, product, and data to ship measurable impact.
* Comfort working in tier 0 critical environments where accuracy and trust matter.


 Technologies We Use and Teach
   

  

* Backend: Java, Kotlin, Go, Ruby on Rails
* Data \\& ML: Python, Airflow, Spark, Snowflake, TensorFlow, Databricks
* Infra: Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Protocol Buffers, Temporal

**Who We Are** 




 We’re a Private Equity / investment firm embarking on setting up our A.I. specific arm of the company. The goal is to build AI\\-powered tools to transform how we manage due diligence, investor relations, and portfolio operations across more than 50 portfolio companies.
 



  





 Our leadership team is deeply invested in building this capability from the ground up. We’ve completed our first proof\\-of\\-concept project with a contract engineer and now we’re ready to bring on a Founding AI/ML Engineer to own and expand this function.
 



  





 This is a rare opportunity to join a greenfield initiative — you’ll have full ownership over the technical direction, collaborate directly with leadership, and build tools that have both internal and portfolio\\-wide impact.
 








  





**What’s The Job** 




 As the Founding AI/ML Engineer, you’ll be the driving force behind the design, development, and deployment of our core AI and data products. You’ll operate across the full stack — from data infrastructure and modeling to product integration — with the autonomy to shape our systems and tooling choices.
 








  





**What You’ll Do:** 



* Lead development of internal AI systems from scratch — including RAG pipelines, intelligent document processing (e.g. automating DDQ and NDA workflows), and investor relations tools.
* Partner closely with the Head of Product to define requirements and co\\-develop solutions for both internal operations and portfolio companies.
* Build production\\-ready models that can be customized and deployed across 50\\+ portfolio companies, supporting a range of use cases.
* Work hands\\-on across the stack (Python, SQL, backend integrations) to ship features quickly and iterate based on feedback.
* Collaborate directly with leadership — including the CEO, Head of Investments, and Product team — to identify new opportunities where AI can improve efficiency and insight.
* Define the long\\-term technical roadmap, making key decisions on frameworks, infrastructure, and best practices (current preference is PyTorch, but you’ll have the freedom to choose).



  





 This is not a pure research or data science role — it’s an applied engineering position where you’ll translate ideas into usable, production\\-ready systems.
 








  





**What Skills We’re Looking For** 




*Core Profile:* 



* Strong Computer Science background (Bachelor’s or Master’s from a top university preferred).
* 3–10 years of hands\\-on experience in Software \\+ ML engineering.
* Proven experience taking projects end\\-to\\-end — from concept to production — not just analysis or experimentation.
* Deep technical skills across Python, data pipelines, model development, backend architecture, and AI/ML application.
* Familiarity with latest AI technologies \\& tools; fine\\-tuning models, RAGs etc.
* Comfortable in a blank\\-slate environment with minimal existing infrastructure.
* Excited by both the technical and business impact of their work — able to propose and own new ideas that improve efficiency and outcomes.



*Bonus / Preferred Backgrounds:* 



* Experience at both Big Tech (technical rigor) and startups (ownership and agility).
* Prior exposure to building or deploying AI tools in production.
* Strong communication skills — able to collaborate with product and business stakeholders effectively.
* Entrepreneurial mindset — enjoys working independently with high autonomy and accountability.



*Who typically isn’t a fit:* 



* Specialists limited to data science, consulting, or research\\-only roles.
* Engineers who haven’t owned full product lifecycles or operated without large support teams.








  





**Compensation:** 



* $200,000 \\- $300,000 Base Salary \\+ Bonus (based on experience)
* Full benefits package



  





  





**Why This Opportunity?** 




 This is a foundational hire — a chance to define the AI vision, architecture, and culture for an organization that’s serious about using technology to transform an industry. You’ll have the autonomy of a startup engineer, the resources of an established firm, and the opportunity to shape products that touch dozens of companies.","Data Infrastructure and Analytics and Staffing and Recruiting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/averity","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQGamq-8hsCt-A/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1631324610445?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aedrKWtFGzGegFpCuFD7piz2ILK6LP-AA503EPQlow0","","","","","","","","","","",""

**Who We Are**
 Our mission at Hazel is simple and powerful. We use AI to help U.S. government purchasing teams buy at the speed of need with unparalleled efficiency and cost\\-effectiveness. It is a $2\\.7T problem every single year, and Hazel is at the forefront with State, Local, and EDucation (SLED) and federal government agencies.
   

  

 Government procurement has moved at a glacial pace for decades, stovepiped by complex processes, regulatory capture, and overworked civil servants. The impacts are severe. Our founders saw at Palantir and BCG how lowly procurement challenges fueled wildfires across California, compromised critical U.S. national security systems, and wasted billions of dollars.
   

  

 Hazel has identified a once\\-in\\-a\\-lifetime opportunity to solve this by deploying cutting\\-edge AI to the public sector and unlocking the full potential of our nation. We empower our partners to move with expediency against the most pressing challenges of this century including climate sustainability, great power competition, and more. Hazel builds AI for the public interest.
   

  

**What We Are Building**
 Hazel is transforming government procurement – how government agencies purchase goods and services from commercial vendors. This includes everything from water bottles to housing to next generation defense drones. Our platform supports the entire procurement lifecycle from need identification through award management. Hazel’s partners include state \\& local governments, schools, and federal agencies with whom we develop a product with features including solicitation creation, market research, evaluations, and more.
   

  

**Why Join Hazel**
 Hazel has unparalleled access and insight into how top government stakeholders manage billions in public funds. Our mission is to help our partners further stretch every dollar and deliver on what their mission.
   

  

 As a Hazel engineer, you’ll architect and deploy secure, scalable systems that bring AI to government procurement. You’ll own features end\\-to\\-end, from backend services and data pipelines to model integration and front\\-end delivery, helping our partners move faster and smarter. Hazel combines startup speed with the mission focus of public service.
   

  

 You’ll work side\\-by\\-side with inquisitive and driven founders as well as a world\\-class and dynamic founding engineering team. Hazel continuously promotes learning and provides numerous resources from other founders, startups, and VCs.
   

  

 Hazel is a mission\\-driven organization founded by engineers and built around delivering world\\-class innovation to our government partners. We strive for excellence, deliver impact, and have fun doing it.
   

  

**How You Fit Us**
 You care about mission. Hazel partners with agencies supporting everything from public school teachers in the classroom to warfighters in the field. We believe in products which change America for the better.
   

  

 You solve problems. There’s no more time to opine on strategy and policy when our nation faces existential challenges, today. We are workhorses, not showhorses.
   

  

 You are always learning. Nobody has all the answers, and the world is ever\\-evolving, so we must be adaptive. We bring the best practices available from all domains to meet the challenge.
   

  

 You believe in team. Our team grows together, supports one another, and elevates our shared successes. We are more effective together.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a Hazel full stack engineer, you will be at the helm of architecting and building Hazel’s platform.

 We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.

This wasn't the end goal, it was how we deeply understood the complexity needed to build software that actually works in regulated industries.
   

  

 The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%\\+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.

 Valon is building the AI\\-native operating system for regulated finance, starting with mortgage servicing.
   

  

 We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.
   

  

 Rather than build on top of broken legacy systems, we took a different approach: we built and operate our own mortgage servicing business managing $110\\+ billion in loans. This wasn't the end goal, it was how we deeply understood the complexity needed to build software that actually works in regulated industries.
   

  

 The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%\\+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.
   

  

 ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations. Mortgage servicing is just the beginning of our vision to transform regulated industries and beyond.
   

  

**Engineering at Valon**
 Our engineering team is here to power the software ecosystem to disrupt one of the most outdated and regulated spaces in the financial sector \\- the mortgage industry. We’ve built out the foundation of a modern mortgage servicing platform that can accurately handle billions of dollars at scale, but we’re just getting started. At Valon, we want you to do the best work of your life. You'll be surrounded by a tight\\-knit community of exceptional people from places like Stripe, Jane Street, Meta, and Google who care deeply about their work and each other. Our problem space is complex, but you’ll get a lot of autonomy so that you can learn quickly, execute effectively, and deliver the highest level of business impact. Our tech stack is built on Python, React, Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Platform.
