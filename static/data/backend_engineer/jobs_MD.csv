 The work environment and requirements described below are representative of those necessary for an employee to successfully perform the essential functions of this role.
   

  

**The Physical Side of the Role:** 
 Given that a good portion of your day will be spent at a desk, you should be comfortable with prolonged periods of focused work, whether it's collaborating with colleagues, analyzing data, or developing strategies. The role demands effective communication and sharp visual acuity for reviewing complex documents and performing detailed computer work. While there are times for quiet concentration, you'll also be expected to move actively throughout the office and travel occasionally to various locations, including dynamic construction sites, utilizing different modes of transportation. The ability to lift and move objects up to 10 pounds regularly, and up to 25 pounds on occasion (think a box of files or small office equipment), is also required.
   

  

**Your Work Environment:** 
 Your primary workspace will be in our professional office, which has a typical, quiet\\-to\\-moderate noise and light levels. As part of your work, you may also be required to visit active construction sites. These environments are naturally more dynamic and can include exposure to outdoor weather conditions, louder noise, and moving equipment. Your safety is our top priority, and you'll be expected to follow Clark Construction's safety policies and procedures, and all applicable laws, at all locations.
   

  

**Our High\\-Performing Culture:** 
 This is a demanding, high\\-performance environment. We are looking for candidates who are energized by challenge, thrive under pressure, and are prepared to do what it takes to achieve exceptional results. Success in this role requires significant commitment, including flexibility to work extended hours, especially during critical project phases or client deadlines. Beyond regular working hours, there will be occasions where business needs require your attention, particularly for time\\-sensitive matters or emergencies. You are expected to monitor and respond to communications (phone calls, emails, text messages) as required to address these situations effectively. Your ability to manage these expectations and be responsive when critical issues arise is key to your success in this role and our collective success as a team.
   

  

**A Drug Free Workplace:** 
 Clark promotes a drug free workplace. A pre\\-employment drug “fitness for duty” screening is required, and the company conducts random quarterly drug “fitness for duty” tests.","Construction","https://www.linkedin.com/company/clarkconstructiongroup","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQE1VwltopWZ8A/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1681412935572/clarkconstructiongroup_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=KiDJoo0itHBRL5OAkHPFMN1oaqhrJA09ZlDoCT-hH0c","","","","","","","","","","",""

**Benefits**
 Northstrat values true work life balance. We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning.
   

  

 Pay Range
   

  

 There are a host of factors that can influence final salary including, but not limited to, geographic location, Federal Government contract labor categories and contract wage rates, relevant prior work experience, specific skills and competencies, education, and certifications. We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and professional development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.
   

  

 Flex Time
   

  

 Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John’s IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.
   

  

 Individual Benefits Account (IBA)
   

  

 To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset – the employee.
   

  

 The Purpose Of The IBA Is To Provide Attractive Benefits To All Full\\-time Employees Of Northstrat On a Flexible Basis That Enables Each Covered Employee To Select a Package That Best Suits His Or Her Needs. Whether Those Needs Are Paid Time Off, Medical Expenses, Prescription Drug Expenses, Cash Disbursement, Or a Combination Of Any Of These, The IBA Provides Flexibility To Help You Meet Your Specific Goals. The IBA Can Be Used For Such Things As:
   

  

 IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee’s monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee’s salary.
   

  

 Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)
   

  

 The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee’s behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee’s compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.
   

  

 Stock Options
   

  

 Because Northstrat is an employee\\-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.
   

  

 Lifelong Learning
   

  

 Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work\\-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.
   

  

 Join Our Talented Team
   

  

 We hire the BEST employees and value each one. Since 2021, The Washington Post has recognized Northstrat among its ""Top Workplaces"". We think that your friends and family will like it here too, so we offer employee referral incentives.

**About The Team**
 The
 **Connected Warfare** 
 division builds systems to support global command and control missions. We create joint, time sensitive, multi domain, ubiquitous, connected mesh ecosystems. Our ecosystem enables connected warfare with disproportional impact by connecting every robot, human, and sensor in every domain, bringing together hundreds of thousands of end points across the globe. We are the substrate that provides the source of truth for time sensitive decision, effectively transforming the way that militaries close kills chains and enable mission autonomy.
   

  

 The Mission Core Group In The Connected Warfare Division Focuses On Building a Core Software Product That Enables Every Customer Delivery To Succeed And To Meet The Needs Of Our Warfighters. The Mission Core Group Is Comprised Of Three Teams
   

  

* Mesh Platform \\- responsible for building the foundational technology that supports resilient, performant, near real time distributed operations in wartime scenarios, from the tactical edge to the data center and everywhere in between.
* Data Interfaces \\- responsible for building the interfaces and systems that ingest data into and allow data to be exported from the mesh system.
* Release Management \\- responsible for infrastructure, guidelines, and processes that guarantee quality software is delivered to production environments including network emulation, software in the loop test environments, and release pipelines.


 Mission Core team members operate in focus areas but contribute across boundaries as needed.

We keep the mission top\\-of\\-mind while making sound engineering decisions to deliver on\\-time, high quality software and pre\\-emptively meet the challenges of the future.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Own software spanning Mission Core: mesh platform, data interfaces, and release management
* Deliver well architected systems through clear interfaces across components, code reviews, design reviews and modern software engineering practices.
* Champion test\\-ability, portability, monitoring, scalability, reliability, and maintainability as core parts of software delivery.
* Generate software solutions from problem definition and solution design, through to implementation and delivery to customers
* Collaborate across multiple teams to plan, build, and test complex functionality
