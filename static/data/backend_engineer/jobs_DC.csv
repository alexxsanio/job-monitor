 The work environment and requirements described below are representative of those necessary for an employee to successfully perform the essential functions of this role.
   

  

**The Physical Side of the Role:** 
 Given that a good portion of your day will be spent at a desk, you should be comfortable with prolonged periods of focused work, whether it's collaborating with colleagues, analyzing data, or developing strategies. The role demands effective communication and sharp visual acuity for reviewing complex documents and performing detailed computer work. While there are times for quiet concentration, you'll also be expected to move actively throughout the office and travel occasionally to various locations, including dynamic construction sites, utilizing different modes of transportation. The ability to lift and move objects up to 10 pounds regularly, and up to 25 pounds on occasion (think a box of files or small office equipment), is also required.
   

  

**Your Work Environment:** 
 Your primary workspace will be in our professional office, which has a typical, quiet\\-to\\-moderate noise and light levels. As part of your work, you may also be required to visit active construction sites. These environments are naturally more dynamic and can include exposure to outdoor weather conditions, louder noise, and moving equipment. Your safety is our top priority, and you'll be expected to follow Clark Construction's safety policies and procedures, and all applicable laws, at all locations.
   

  

**Our High\\-Performing Culture:** 
 This is a demanding, high\\-performance environment. We are looking for candidates who are energized by challenge, thrive under pressure, and are prepared to do what it takes to achieve exceptional results. Success in this role requires significant commitment, including flexibility to work extended hours, especially during critical project phases or client deadlines. Beyond regular working hours, there will be occasions where business needs require your attention, particularly for time\\-sensitive matters or emergencies. You are expected to monitor and respond to communications (phone calls, emails, text messages) as required to address these situations effectively. Your ability to manage these expectations and be responsive when critical issues arise is key to your success in this role and our collective success as a team.
   

  

**A Drug Free Workplace:** 
 Clark promotes a drug free workplace. A pre\\-employment drug “fitness for duty” screening is required, and the company conducts random quarterly drug “fitness for duty” tests.","Construction","https://www.linkedin.com/company/clarkconstructiongroup","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQE1VwltopWZ8A/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1681412935572/clarkconstructiongroup_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=KiDJoo0itHBRL5OAkHPFMN1oaqhrJA09ZlDoCT-hH0c","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Work/Life Balance
   

  

 Northstrat values true work life balance. We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning.
   

  

 Pay Range
   

  

 There are a host of factors that can influence final salary including, but not limited to, geographic location, Federal Government contract labor categories and contract wage rates, relevant prior work experience, specific skills and competencies, education, and certifications. We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and profession development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.
   

  

 Flex Time
   

  

 Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John’s IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.
   

  

 Individual Benefits Account (IBA)
   

  

 To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset – the employee.
   

  

 The Purpose Of The IBA Is To Provide Attractive Benefits To All Full\\-time Employees Of Northstrat On a Flexible Basis That Enables Each Covered Employee To Select a Package That Best Suits His Or Her Needs. Whether Those Needs Are Paid Time Off, Medical Expenses, Prescription Drug Expenses, Cash Disbursement, Or a Combination Of Any Of These, The IBA Provides Flexibility To Help You Meet Your Specific Goals. The IBA Can Be Used For Such Things As:
   

  

* Medical and Vision Insurance through United Health Care; Dental insurance through Delta Dental
* 100% Medical Reimbursement
* Time Off with Pay
* Profit Sharing Plan
* 401k
* Educational Benefits
* Additional Income


 IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee’s monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee’s salary.
   

  

 Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)
   

  

 The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee’s behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee’s compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.
   

  

 Stock Options
   

  

 Because Northstrat is an employee\\-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.
   

  

 Lifelong Learning
   

  

 Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through the use of company provided online learning opportunities, periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work\\-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.

 Skylight is a digital consultancy using design and technology to help government agencies deliver better public services. We’re at the forefront of a civic movement to reinvent how all levels of government serve families, patients, and many others in today's digital world.
 



 If you want to play a part in driving this critical movement forward, we’d love for you to join our growing team of public interest technologists. The work we do matters.
 



  





**About the job** 




 At Skylight, lead software engineers combine hands\\-on development with technical leadership to guide strategy and delivery. They raise the engineering bar while ensuring systems are secure, resilient, and scalable.
 



  





 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is launching one of the most ambitious transformations in government — and this is a rare chance to be part of it. You’ll join a high\\-impact team of product managers, researchers, designers, engineers, and security experts working side\\-by\\-side with HHS leadership to modernize the systems people rely on to access healthcare, strengthen cybersecurity that protects personal data, launch digital services used by tens of millions every day, and integrate data and AI responsibly into daily work across the department so teams at every level can make smarter, safer decisions.
 



  





 As a lead software engineer on this project, you’ll provide direction while staying hands\\-on, designing and building services with an emphasis on reliability, security, and simplicity. You’ll help standardize engineering practices, improve observability, and embed security and compliance into delivery from the start. Just as importantly, you’ll prepare federal teams to sustain these improvements by sharing knowledge and practices that last — from training and enablement to reusable tools like templates, playbooks, and decision records.
 



  





**What you’ll do** 



* Lead technical direction for one or more products and platforms, from discovery through production operations
* Design and build services with an emphasis on reliability, security, and iterative releases
* Apply modern delivery practices — including continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), trunk\\-based development, code review, and automated testing
* Standardize environments with infrastructure as code (IaC) and policy as code for secure, repeatable delivery
* Improve observability and service health with metrics, logs, and traces, guided by service level objectives (SLOs)
* Embed security and compliance from day one, supporting evidence automation and continuous Authority to Operate (ATO) practices
* Mentor engineers, facilitate technical design reviews, and model pragmatic, high\\-quality engineering practices
* Help federal teams sustain improvements by delivering training and enablement, and by leaving behind reusable resources such as templates, playbooks, and decision records



  





**What we're looking for** 




***Minimum qualifications***



* Experience leading engineering for complex, production systems and delivering measurable outcomes
* Strong hands\\-on skills building services and APIs in a modern language and runtime, with clean, reliable, reusable code
* Familiarity with modern delivery practices — CI/CD, automated testing, code review, and operating services in cloud environments
* Proficiency with IaC and environment automation
* Understanding of secure software practices and how to integrate compliance into delivery
* Knowledge of data persistence and patterns for building resilient, observable services
* Clear communication skills with executives and cross\\-functional teams
* Commitment to equipping federal teams with documentation, training, and mentoring so improvements last beyond the contract
* Ability to work effectively in a professional services environment
* Passion for improving public outcomes through great government services
* A mindset and work approach that align with Skylight’s
 
 core values
* Ability to spend time on‑site at HHS in Washington, DC — either by being based locally or by traveling regularly for in‑person work when it’s important



  





**Nice\\-to\\-have qualifications** 



* Experience with containers and orchestration (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) or platform engineering
* Background in cloud and application modernization, integrations, or shared services at enterprise scale
* Familiarity with compliance and security environments such as ATO, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), or the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)
* Experience guiding cost, performance, and reliability tradeoffs across multiple teams
* Track record of mentoring engineers and raising engineering practices across organizations
* Experience working effectively on hybrid or distributed teams



  





*Don’t meet 100% of the criteria but think you can do the job? We’d love to chat anyway! We’re on a mission to build diverse teams, and studies have shown that women and marginalized folks are less likely to apply to jobs if they don’t check every box.* 




  





**Other requirements** 



* All work must be conducted within the U.S., excluding U.S. territories. Some federal contracts require U.S. citizenship to be eligible for employment.
* You must be legally authorized to work in the U.S. now and in the future without sponsorship.
* As a government contractor, you may be required to obtain a public trust or security clearance.
* You may be required to complete a company background check successfully.
* Some of our available roles are on federal contracts that require a degree or additional years of experience as a substitute.



  





**Position type** 




 This is a full\\-time, exempt position.
 



  





**Location** 




 This role requires some in\\-person time in Washington, DC. Candidates based in the DC area should be able to work on\\-site at HHS periodically. Candidates outside the area are also welcome to apply, as long as they can travel to DC frequently for on\\-site collaboration. A relocation incentive of up to $10,000 is available.
 



  





**Care package** 




**Salary**

To that end, we use the results of our interview process to determine what salary is most appropriate given your current level of seniority.

 Work/Life Balance
   

  

 Northstrat values true work life balance. We offer power of choice benefits designed to best meet the needs of you and your lifestyle. Our benefits programs are designed to support and encourage wellness, healthy living, retirement investment, and lifetime learning.
   

  

 Pay Range
   

  

 There are a host of factors that can influence final salary including, but not limited to, geographic location, Federal Government contract labor categories and contract wage rates, relevant prior work experience, specific skills and competencies, education, and certifications. We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and professional development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.
   

  

 Flex Time
   

  

 Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John’s IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.
   

  

 Individual Benefits Account (IBA)
   

  

 To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset – the employee.
   

  

 The Purpose Of The IBA Is To Provide Attractive Benefits To All Full\\-time Employees Of Northstrat On a Flexible Basis That Enables Each Covered Employee To Select a Package That Best Suits His Or Her Needs. Whether Those Needs Are Paid Time Off, Medical Expenses, Prescription Drug Expenses, Cash Disbursement, Or a Combination Of Any Of These, The IBA Provides Flexibility To Help You Meet Your Specific Goals. The IBA Can Be Used For Such Things As:
   

  

 IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee’s monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee’s salary.
   

  

 Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)
   

  

 The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee’s behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee’s compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.
   

  

 Stock Options
   

  

 Because Northstrat is an employee\\-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.
   

  

 Lifelong Learning
   

  

 Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work\\-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.
   

  

 Join Our Talented Team
   

  

 We hire the BEST employees and value each one. Since 2021, The Washington Post has recognized Northstrat among its ""Top Workplaces"". We think that your friends and family will like it here too, so we offer employee referral incentives.
