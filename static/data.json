Further information can be found at www.man.com\n   \n\n  \n\n* As at 30 September 2025\n\n\n The Role\n   \n\n  \n\n As a Software Engineer in the Front\\\\-office Engineering organization at Man Numeric, you will work closely with Quantitative Researchers and Portfolio Managers. Your challenges will be varied and may include onboarding new datasets, implementing new trading signals, developing portfolio optimization tools, building data visualization frameworks, enhancing our research platform, and performance tuning existing code using efficient numerical algorithms and cluster\\\\-computing solutions.\n   \n\n  \n\n Our Technology\n   \n\n  \n\n Our systems are almost all running on Linux and most of our code is in Python, with the full scientific stack: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, statsmodels, and scikit\\\\-learn to name a few of the libraries we use extensively. We implement the systems that require the highest data throughput in Java. For storage, we rely heavily on MongoDB and MS SQL.\n   \n\n  \n\n We use Control\\\\-M and Airflow for workflow management, Kafka for data pipelines, Bitbucket for source control, Jenkins for continuous integration, Grafana \\\\+ Prometheus for metrics collection, ELK for log shipping and monitoring, Docker for containerisation, OpenStack for our private cloud, Ansible for architecture automation, and Slack for internal communication. Our technology list is never static: we constantly evaluate new tools and libraries.\n   \n\n  \n\n Working Here\n   \n\n  \n\n Man Numeric has a small company, no\\\\-attitude feel. It is flat structured, open, transparent and collaborative, and you will have plenty of opportunity to grow and have enormous impact on what we do. We are actively engaged with the broader technology community.\n   \n\n  \n\n* We regularly talk at leading industry conferences, and tweet about relevant technology and how we\u2019re using it. See @manquanttech\n* We host and sponsor Boston meetups and London\u2019s PyData and Machine Learning Meetups\n* We open\\\\-source some of our technology, including our ultra\\\\-high\\\\-performance DataFrame database, ArcticDB. See https://github.com/man\\\\-group for a full list and more information.\n\n\n We\u2019re fortunate enough to have a fantastic open\\\\-plan office overlooking the Boston harbour, and continually strive to make our environment a great place in which to work. We believe that agile working allows us to deliver the best business outcomes for our clients and investors as well as having a positive impact on work\\\\-life balance and the wellbeing of our staff. We are simultaneously committed to \u201clevelling the playing field\u201d and believe that agile working promotes inclusivity across teams, regions and business units. In general, Technology roles are expected to be in the office for 3 days a week. However, the specifics can vary based on the role, team, and individual circumstances, and are ultimately subject to the manager\u2019s discretion.\n   \n\n  \n\n We offer competitive compensation, a generous holiday allowance, various health and other flexible benefits. We are also committed to continuous learning and development via coaching, mentoring, regular conference attendance and sponsoring academic and professional qualifications.\n   \n\n  \n\n Technology and Business Skills\n   \n\n  \n\n We strive to hire only the brightest, best and most highly skilled, passionate technologists.",

Warner, Sony, and Universal trust us to break their biggest artists. We're backed by the biggest names in entertainment including Sofia Vergara, Karol G, Tommy Mottola, and Tier 1 VCs like Point72 Ventures. We're not building for hypothetical use cases. We're shipping production AI that drives millions in revenue today.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Why we'll win:** \n We have what no one else has: both the data and the distribution. We have proprietary data on thousands of influencers and what makes content go viral, plus direct relationships with the influencers themselves. In the AI era, having both is the moat. Everyone else has one or the other. We have both.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Why now:** \n AGI agents will replace middle level work by 2027\\\\. We have a 12 to 18 month window before the market floods with agents. We're building the category defining social media viral agent right now.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What we're looking for:** \n Young talent ready to go all in. We're offering significant equity to people who want to build something that matters. This isn't a job. It's an opportunity to define the future of AI in influencer marketing and own a meaningful piece of it.",

We were founded in 2017 by one of the world\u2019s leading cardiologists and are a growing team of world\\\\-class engineering, operations, medical affairs, marketing, and sales leaders. We raised $223M in Series C funding in 2022 which has enabled rapid growth and continued support of our mission. In December 2024 we received an additional $106M in a Series C extension funding. Most of our teams work remotely and have access to our offices in Denver, Colorado, New, York, New York, Dallas, Texas, and Lisbon, Portugal with some roles requiring you to be on\\\\-site in a location.\n   \n\n  \n\n Cleerly has created a new standard of care for heart disease through value\\\\-based, AI\\\\-driven precision diagnostic solutions with the goal of helping prevent heart attacks. Our technology goes beyond traditional measures of heart disease by enabling comprehensive quantification and characterization of atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup, in each of the heart arteries. Cleerly\u2019s solutions are supported by more than a decade of performing some of the world\u2019s largest clinical trials to identify important findings beyond symptoms that increase a person\u2019s risk of heart attacks.\n   \n\n  \n\n At Cleerly, we collaborate digitally and use a wide variety of systems. Our people use Google Workspace (GMail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides), Slack, Confluence/Jira, and Zoom Video, prior experience in these areas is a plus. Role or department specific technology needs may vary and will be listed as requirements in the job description.\n   \n\n  \n\n While we are mostly a remote company, travel is required for some team meetings and cross function projects typically once per month or once per quarter, for some roles like sales or external facing roles travel could be up to 90% of the time.",

We were founded in 2017 by one of the world\u2019s leading cardiologists and are a growing team of world\\\\-class engineering, operations, medical affairs, marketing, and sales leaders. We raised $223M in Series C funding in 2022 which has enabled rapid growth and continued support of our mission. In December 2024 we received an additional $106M in a Series C extension funding. Most of our teams work remotely and have access to our offices in Denver, Colorado, New, York, New York, Dallas, Texas, and Lisbon, Portugal with some roles requiring you to be on\\\\-site in a location.\n   \n\n  \n\n Cleerly has created a new standard of care for heart disease through value\\\\-based, AI\\\\-driven precision diagnostic solutions with the goal of helping prevent heart attacks. Our technology goes beyond traditional measures of heart disease by enabling comprehensive quantification and characterization of atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup, in each of the heart arteries. Cleerly\u2019s solutions are supported by more than a decade of performing some of the world\u2019s largest clinical trials to identify important findings beyond symptoms that increase a person\u2019s risk of heart attacks.\n   \n\n  \n\n At Cleerly, we collaborate digitally and use a wide variety of systems. Our people use Google Workspace (GMail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides), Slack, Confluence/Jira, and Zoom Video, prior experience in these areas is a plus. Role or department specific technology needs may vary and will be listed as requirements in the job description.\n   \n\n  \n\n While we are mostly a remote company, travel is required for some team meetings and cross function projects typically once per month or once per quarter, for some roles like sales or external facing roles travel could be up to 90% of the time.",

    "about": "At Scribd (pronounced \u201cscribbed\u201d), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our four products: Everand, Scribd, Slideshare, and Fable.\n   \n\n  \n\n We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.\n   \n\n  \n\n When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It\u2019s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees \u2013 in partnership with their manager \u2013 can choose the daily work\\\\-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in\\\\-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in\\\\-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.\n   \n\n  \n\n So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for \u201cGRIT\u201d. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT\\\\-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here\u2019s what that means for you: we\u2019re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve\n **G** \n oals, achieve\n **R** \n esults within their job responsibilities, contribute\n **I** \n nnovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader\n **T** \n eam through collaboration and attitude.",

It\u2019s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees \u2013 in partnership with their manager \u2013 can choose the daily work\\\\-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in\\\\-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in\\\\-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.\n   \n\n  \n\n So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for \u201cGRIT\u201d. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT\\\\-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to.

Many customers of these legacy products are looking to replace them with a modern SaaS solution like AODocs.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Our product is used by large organizations such as Google, Veolia or Colgate to control their critical documents, protecting them against costly human errors while accelerating key business processes. Our client\u2019s main use cases are document control for large engineering projects, standard operating procedures, quality management, consulting and audit reports, and more generally, all business processes involving important documents in professional services, healthcare, HR, procurement, legal, and more.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n The generative AI wave represents an important opportunity for AODocs, as more and more companies realize that AI assistants cannot work on messy information. AODocs' ability to control documents and their versions, can be used to ensure AI assistants only work on the right, validated content, thus allowing AODocs to benefit from the AI market traction.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Our team of 130 is composed of highly motivated and competent people.

It\u2019s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees \u2013 in partnership with their manager \u2013 can choose the daily work\\\\-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in\\\\-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in\\\\-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.\n   \n\n  \n\n So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for \u201cGRIT\u201d. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT\\\\-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here\u2019s what that means for you: we\u2019re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve\n **G** \n oals, achieve\n **R** \n esults within their job responsibilities, contribute\n **I** \n nnovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader\n **T** \n eam through collaboration and attitude.",

Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our four products: Everand, Scribd, Slideshare, and Fable.\n   \n\n  \n\n We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.\n   \n\n  \n\n When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It\u2019s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees \u2013 in partnership with their manager \u2013 can choose the daily work\\\\-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in\\\\-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in\\\\-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.\n   \n\n  \n\n So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for \u201cGRIT\u201d. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT\\\\-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here\u2019s what that means for you: we\u2019re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve\n **G** \n oals, achieve\n **R** \n esults within their job responsibilities, contribute\n **I** \n nnovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader\n **T** \n eam through collaboration and attitude.",

Norm hired dozens of lawyers from premier U.S. law firms and trained them as Legal Engineers, who specialize in breaking down legal workflows into units of analysis targeted enough to reliably leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning. The granular LLM outputs that constitute a given workflow are orchestrated in a logically structured and human interpretable manner and rigorously validated against data and expertise. The resulting dynamic systems can complete the first pass of the legal workflow and provide detailed explanations.\n   \n\n  \n\n We also developed the first Domain Specific Language (DSL) for fully representing regulatory requirements in AI code. This DSL, deployed with our enterprise platform, enables Norm clients to transform workflows and apply compliance checks at the source of business activities.\n   \n\n  \n\n Norm Ai technology is deployed inside some of the largest and most consequential institutions in the world.

    "about": "We repressent a company building an AI platform that serves as a Watchtower for global supply chains. They are beginning with one of the most critical and complex networks in the world: the global food supply chain that moves food from farm to table. In just a short period, they have gone from concept to product, onboarded early customers, and are already automating more than $10 million in monthly orders with no human involvement. Their technology is helping businesses save millions in payroll while increasing net profits by up to 20 percent within weeks of going live.\n   \n\n  \n\n After securing $3\\\\.8 million in funding from leading investors, they are now expanding its founding team. They are looking for elite, ambitious builders to help scale from their strong foothold in food distribution to broader enterprise deployments across the full supply chain landscape, including freight, manufacturing, and distribution.\n   \n\n  \n\n They are helping its customers modernize operations and move beyond outdated ERP systems into the era of AI. Their intelligent agents do more than sit on top of legacy platforms like SAP or NetSuite\u2014they actively help run the business. What Salesforce did for CRM, this team is doing for the entire supply chain stack. The global food supply chain alone represents a $10 trillion opportunity, and for them, that is only the beginning.",

Warner, Sony, and Universal trust us to break their biggest artists. We're backed by the biggest names in entertainment including Sofia Vergara, Karol G, Tommy Mottola, and Tier 1 VCs like Point72 Ventures. We're not building for hypothetical use cases. We're shipping production AI that drives millions in revenue today.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Why we'll win:** \n We have what no one else has: both the data and the distribution. We have proprietary data on thousands of influencers and what makes content go viral, plus direct relationships with the influencers themselves. In the AI era, having both is the moat. Everyone else has one or the other. We have both.\n   \n\n  \n\n**Why now:** \n AGI agents will replace middle level work by 2027\\\\. We have a 12 to 18 month window before the market floods with agents. We're building the category defining social media viral agent right now.\n   \n\n  \n\n**What we're looking for:** \n Young talent ready to go all in. We're offering significant equity to people who want to build something that matters. This isn't a job.

So we decided to upgrade it.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Engineers make million\\\\-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI\\\\-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non\\\\-destructively.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n We rebuilt the whole system, from X\\\\-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web\\\\-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We\u2019re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights.

    "about": "EnsoData strives to make healthcare more accurate, efficient, and affordable through waveform artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Using AI and machine learning, our software analyzes billions of data points collected from sensors placed throughout the human body. Our first solution, EnsoSleep, reduces the time clinicians spend analyzing, scoring and managing sleep studies. This results in a simplified and accelerated patient testing, diagnosis, and treatment workflow. Our AI\\\\-powered technology has the capability of informing health decisions beyond sleep medicine, from monitoring patient health in the ICU or through wearables, to detecting and capturing seizure data, to providing earlier detection of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and Alzheimer's.\n   \n\n  \n\n Here is a little about what we are doing in the world of sleep medicine...\n   \n\n  \n\n EnsoSleep \\\\- FDA\\\\-Cleared PSG and HSAT Scoring and Study Management\n   \n\n  \n\n EnsoSleep PPG \\\\- FDA\\\\-Cleared, AI\\\\-Powered Sleep Diagnosis Using Pulse Oximeters\n   \n\n  \n\n* Here is a link to learn a little about our Celeste app!",
