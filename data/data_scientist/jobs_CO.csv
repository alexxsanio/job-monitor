 At Scribd (pronounced “scribbed”), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our four products: Everand, Scribd, Slideshare, and Fable.
   

  

 We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.
   

  

 When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It’s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees – in partnership with their manager – can choose the daily work\\-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in\\-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in\\-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.
   

  

 So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for “GRIT”. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals.

Here’s what they said.**
 At most companies, engineers wait.
   

  

 Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.
   

  

 At Jerry.ai, we don’t wait.
   

  

 If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it — sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us:
 ***“At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.”***
 That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you’ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior — sometimes the same week they ship.
 ***“Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,”***
 said another.
 ***“And things move fast.”***
 We don’t do bureaucracy. We don’t do politics. Everyone here — from our CTO to our tech leads — writes code and sweats the details.
 ***“The leaders here lead by example,”***
 one teammate shared.
 ***“They have very high standards. They don’t settle for just OK.”***
 It’s challenging work, but it’s meaningful. You’ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You’ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly:
 ***“I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.”***
 We’re a remote\\-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.
   

  

**So, what is** 
**Jerry.ai** 
**and why should you care?🤔**
 Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you’ll ever own — and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we’re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we’re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion\\+ problem and we’re the only company tackling it end\\-to\\-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next.
   

  

**What You’ll Work On**
* Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end\\-to\\-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage.
* Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1–2 weeks on average.
* Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules.
* Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re\\-shopping experiences.
* Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in\\-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero.
* Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention.
* Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack.
* Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture.


**Our Tech Stack**
* Frontend \\& backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo
* API: GraphQL
* Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda
* Our business has grown more complex over time. We’re refactoring major parts of our code base — simplifying old systems, rebuilding core flows, and setting up the next three years of our platform’s growth. You’ll help build the foundation for that next phase.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Experience: At least 2 years full stack engineering experience building production\\-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast\\-growing consumer\\-facing software
* Technical strength: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than prior experience with our tech stack.
* Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.
* Ownership: You take responsibility for end\\-to\\-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.
* Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills.
* Curiosity \\+ adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.


 This isn’t another coding job.
 **You’ll work in a flexible** 
 , fast\\-moving, and
 **highly** 
**collaborative** 
**culture** 
 , where
 **innovation** 
**is** 
**encouraged** 
 ,
 **your voice is heard**

 **impact of your work is immediate** 
 . You’ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn, and grow alongside talented peers.

Here’s what they said.**
 At most companies, engineers wait.
   

  

 Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.
   

  

 At Jerry.ai, we don’t wait.
   

  

 If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it — sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us:
 ***“At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.”***
 That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you’ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior — sometimes the same week they ship.
 ***“Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,”***
 said another.
 ***“And things move fast.”***
 We don’t do bureaucracy. We don’t do politics. Everyone here — from our CTO to our tech leads — writes code and sweats the details.
 ***“The leaders here lead by example,”***
 one teammate shared.
 ***“They have very high standards. They don’t settle for just OK.”***
 It’s challenging work, but it’s meaningful. You’ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You’ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly:
 ***“I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.”***
 We’re a remote\\-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.
   

  

**So, what is** 
**Jerry.ai** 
**and why should you care?🤔**
 Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you’ll ever own — and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we’re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we’re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion\\+ problem and we’re the only company tackling it end\\-to\\-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next.
   

  

**What You’ll Work On**
* Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end\\-to\\-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage.
* Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1–2 weeks on average.
* Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules.
* Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re\\-shopping experiences.
* Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in\\-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero.
* Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention.
* Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack.
* Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture.


**Our Tech Stack**
* Frontend \\& backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo
* API: GraphQL
* Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda
* Our business has grown more complex over time. We’re refactoring major parts of our code base — simplifying old systems, rebuilding core flows, and setting up the next three years of our platform’s growth. You’ll help build the foundation for that next phase.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Experience: At least 5 years full stack engineering experience building production\\-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast\\-growing consumer\\-facing software
* Technical strength: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than prior experience with our tech stack.
* Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.
* Ownership: You take responsibility for end\\-to\\-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.
* Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills.
* Curiosity \\+ adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.


 This isn’t another coding job.
 **You’ll work in a flexible** 
 , fast\\-moving, and
 **highly** 
**collaborative** 
**culture** 
 , where
 **innovation** 
**is** 
**encouraged** 
 ,
 **your voice is heard** 
 , and the
 **impact of your work is immediate** 
 . You’ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn, and grow alongside talented peers.
