 OpenAI Labs explores the edges of what’s possible with AI. We start from the latest breakthroughs – or overlooked research with untapped potential – and expand their capabilities by prototyping entirely new ways for people to benefit from AI.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a Full\\-Stack Software Engineer on the Labs team, you will create new ways for people to interact with AI.
   

  

 Your work will begin as rapid internal experiments: prototypes built to explore surprising capabilities or novel interfaces. Some will spark entirely new products or research directions, shaping how millions of people experience AI. Across projects, you’ll ship these ideas internally, learn from how people use them, and – if they prove promising – hand them off to product teams to take forward before moving on to the next frontier.
   

  

 Sometimes you’ll start by playing with a researcher’s early demo, identify emerging behaviors, and push on them in collaboration with researchers. Other times, you’ll start from a capability that hasn’t yet been fully explored and design a novel interface around it.
   

  

 We’re looking for creative people who love to tinker and explore, chasing sparks of magic and shaping them into experiences that help the world go further and discover new possibilities.
   

  

**Location**
 This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.
   

  

**In This Role, You Will**
* Explore emerging capabilities and collaborate with researchers to uncover surprising new behaviors – whether from the model itself or from how people respond – and push their limits through creative experimentation.
* Design and prototype new interfaces and interaction patterns that rethink how people experience AI, making powerful capabilities feel intuitive, delightful, and inspiring.
* Bring ideas to life quickly, turning concepts into working demos – and evolving those prototypes into robust, testable experiences ready for real\\-world feedback.
* Ship early, learn from real usage, and iterate fast – refining ideas based on how people actually use them.
* Hand off the most promising prototypes to product teams to scale before moving on to the next frontier.


**You Might Thrive In This Role If You**
* Have demonstrated experience building and shipping full\\-stack applications, from intuitive interfaces to reliable backend systems.
* Build things for fun and care deeply about craft: curiosity drives you, and creating is how you explore ideas.
* Are energized by ambiguity and excited to turn novel capabilities into tangible, working experiences.
* Have a refined product taste and intuition for what great interactions should feel like.
* Care about how ideas work in people’s hands and evolve through real use.
* Value iteration as much as invention; refining is part of the creative process.


**About OpenAI**
 OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general\\-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

We’re Jerry.ai. We’re building the first AI\\-powered
 **AllCar™ super app** 
 to make car ownership affordable, seamless, and even magical. From insurance to repairs to road safety, we’re connecting the entire car ownership experience into one mobile\\-first platform. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from
 **5M → 50M** 
 users next.
   

  

 We’re looking for a
 **Full Stack Software Engineer** 
 to join our
 **Growth Team** 
 , building the core systems that help new users onboard, shop for insurance, and complete their transaction seamlessly in our mobile app. This is a rare opportunity to work on the frontline of our core business growth, tackle complex technical and business challenges, and directly impact acquisition, conversion, and retention for millions of users.
   

  

**Why You’ll Love Working Here**
* Real\\-world impact: Your work touches users from the moment they open the app to the moment they purchase a policy. You’ll directly influence onboarding flows, shopping experiences, and automation for Home, Motorcycle, and Car insurance.
* Challenging work: We are refactoring our entire app code. You’ll help tackle tech debt, refactor complex code, and optimize systems across frontend and backend — building the foundations of the next three years of Jerry’s growth platform.
* Zero bureaucracy: Have an idea? Pitch it, implement it, and see it live in days. No red tape, no slow\\-moving processes.
* Brilliant \\+ supportive teammates: Work with talented and kind engineers, product managers, data scientists and designers. Be in an environment that encourages challenging the status quo, innovation, collaboration, and helping each other succeed.
* Flexibility: Work on projects that excite you. Explore new technologies, like AI/LLM tools, early — without bureaucracy slowing you down. Remote\\-friendly and flexible work arrangements allowing you to balance life and work, even internationally.
* Growth \\+ learning: Engineers at Jerry get to take a ton of ownership, swim outside their lanes, level up quickly, and mentor others. Everyone is passionate, involved, and cares intensely about their work and their teammates.


**What You’ll Do**
 We’re adding 2 software engineers to our growth team. Based on your skills, interests, and our team needs, you will work on a combination of the following:
   

  

* Build and maintain systems that power customer onboarding, shopping, and end\\-to\\-end purchase flows for our car, home and motorcycle insurance marketplace products.
* Work on high\\-visibility initiatives, including revamping pre\\-sale flows for new products from scratch.
* Address technical debt, fix inconsistencies and bugs, and contribute to our tech stack refactoring efforts across our end\\-to\\-end shopping flow.
* Support multiple teams and initiatives in parallel while prioritizing the highest\\-impact work for user conversion and revenue.
* Collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and other engineering teams to improve conversion, automation, and the overall user experience.
* Contribute to both frontend (React/React Native) and backend (Node.js, Nest.js), integrating systems across multiple teams.
* Work asynchronously across time zones, participate in daily standups, and maintain strong communication through Asana and Slack.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Experience: At least 1 year experience including internships (SDE I) or at least 2 years experience (SDE II) building production\\-grade software; ideally full stack with some frontend exposure.
* Tech stack: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than having previous experience with specific languages or frameworks.


**Problem solver:** 
 You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.
   

  

* Ownership: You take responsibility for end\\-to\\-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.
* Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously across teams and time zones, with excellent communication skills.
* Curiosity \\+ adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.


**Our Stack**
* Frontend \\& backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo
* API: GraphQL
* Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda


**Why Jerry?**
 This isn’t just another coding job — you’ll be
 **solving real\\-world problems at scale** 
 , helping millions of people manage their most expensive (or at least second most expensive) asset more effortlessly. You’ll work in a
 **flexible, fast\\-moving, and highly collaborative culture** 
 ,
 **where innovation is encouraged** 
 ,
 **your voice is heard** 
 , and the
 **impact of your work is immediate** 
 . You’ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn constantly, and grow alongside extremely talented engineers.

**Our Operating Principles**
***Extreme Ownership***
 We take full responsibility for our work, outcomes, and team success. No excuses, no blame\\-shifting — if something needs fixing, we own it and make it better. This means stepping up, even when it’s not “your job.” If a ball is dropped, we pick it up. If a customer is unhappy, we fix it. If a process is broken, we redesign it. We don’t wait for someone else to solve it — we lead with accountability and expect the same from those around us.
   

  

***Craftsmanship***
 Putting care and intention into every task, striving for excellence, and taking deep ownership of the quality and outcome of your work. Craftsmanship means never settling for “just fine.” We sweat the details because details compound. Whether it’s a product feature, an internal doc, or a sales call — we treat it as a reflection of our standards. We aim to deliver jaw\\-dropping customer experiences by being curious, meticulous, and proud of what we build — even when nobody’s watching.
   

  

***We are “majos”***
 Be friendly \\& have fun with your coworkers. Always be genuine \\& honest, but kind. “Majo” is our way of saying: be a good human. Be approachable, helpful, and warm. We’re building something ambitious, and it’s easier (and more fun) when we enjoy the ride together. We give feedback with kindness, challenge each other with respect, and celebrate wins together without ego.
   

  

***Urgency with Focus***
 Create the highest impact in the shortest amount of time. Move fast, but in the right direction. We operate with speed because time is our most limited resource. But speed without focus is chaos. We prioritize ruthlessly, act decisively, and stay aligned. We aim for high leverage: the biggest results from the simplest, smartest actions. We’re running a high\\-speed marathon — not a sprint with no strategy.
   

  

***Talent Density and Meritocracy***
 Hire only people who can raise the average; ‘exceptional performance is the passing grade.’ Ability trumps seniority. We believe the best teams are built on talent density — every hire should raise the bar. We reward contribution, not titles or tenure. We give ownership to those who earn it, and we all hold each other to a high standard. A\\-players want to work with other A\\-players — that’s how we win.
   

  

***First\\-Principles Thinking***
 Strip a problem to physics\\-level facts, ignore industry dogma, rebuild the solution from scratch. We don’t copy\\-paste solutions. We go back to basics, ask why things are the way they are, and rebuild from the ground up if needed. This mindset pushes us to innovate, challenge stale assumptions, and move faster than incumbents. It’s how we build what others think is impossible

 Thunder Compute is the lowest cost, easiest GPU cloud for developers. There are two parts to our company:
 



  





  




* We run a cloud platform where developers rent GPUs, just like Coreweave, Lambda, or AWS.
* We build virtualization software that uses GPUs 3x more efficiently than these competitors.



  





  





**About the Role** 




  





  





 As a cloud infrastructure engineer, you will build the infrastructure backbone for our cloud platform. Your days will be a mix of working to solve problems for customers and building resilient, stable production infrastructure. This is a fast\\-paced role where you are expected to learn quickly; we will have you jump in from day one. Our infrastructure is majority GoLang. We use a non\\-standard Kubernetes deployment as a form of hypervisor, with Go scripting for controls and auxiliary services for everything from storage to billing to networking.
 



  





  





 If you worked at a large company and felt restricted working on a single piece of a huge machine, look no further. At Thunder Compute you will work on complicated production infrastructure, learning quickly while interfacing with customers and owning broad scope across the platform.
 



  





  





**Responsibilities** 




  





  




* Build and manage the Kubernetes backbone for our cloud infrastructure
* Write cloud management scripts in GoLang
* Quickly solve production issues for customers
* Attention to detail is critical \\- your code must be reliable and maintainable.
* Clear path to senior leadership as we scale



  





  





**Qualifications** 




  





  




* Self\\-driven with high level of ownership; you will own your work from day 1
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from a leading university



  





  





**Required Skills** 




  





  




* Linux, Git, Bash
* GoLang, Python
* Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform or similar
* CI/CD



  





  





**Preferred Skills** 




  





  




* Experience at a trading firm or cloud provider



  





  





**Pay range and compensation package** 




  





  




* Full\\-time, in\\-person in San Francisco.
* Pay is highly competitive with significant equity. Thunder Compute is profitable on variable costs and on track for $100M\\+ series A valuation.



  





  





**How our virtualization works** 




  





  





 Our core advantage versus other clouds is our proprietary virtualization software.
 



  





 To understand how this virtualization works, think of GPUs like cars. Today, GPU clouds are like car rental agencies; you rent a car for a few days when you need it, but the car sits parked for much of your vacation while you sleep, go to the beach, etc.
 



  





 Thunder Compute allocates GPUs more like Uber; each server has access to a GPU when it is needed, and that GPU serves someone else when it isn't.
 



  





 The end user never has to think about this; they always have a GPU, so from their perspective our servers are identical to other clouds.
 



  





 What's remarkable is that we can pull this off without actually owning any hardware. To extend this analogy, our cloud offering is an arbitrage where we rent ""cars"" from rental agencies (other clouds) and use them as Ubers. The efficiency gain from our software is so large that we have higher margins than the clouds we build on, without the CapEx of building data centers.
 



  





  





**Equal Opportunity Statement** 




  





  





 We are committed to diversity and inclusivity.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/thundercompute","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQE9-8EYi3FPnw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZouglDUIQAQ-/0/1761716884085/thundercompute_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=yWEiGu92glpITJuk-Q1ZVHtFcLeXrDYSKO09s-bGIE4","","","","","","","","","","",""

* Collaborate closely with product, quality, and application teams to prioritize the most impactful roadmap investments.


**You Are**
* 3\\+ years of software engineering experience building production distributed systems or cloud‑native applications.
* BS/BA in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience.
* Strong coding skills in at least one of: Python, Go, Java, or C\\+\\+, with a focus on reliability, performance, and tests.
* Product‑minded: you prioritize customer impact, clear SLAs/SLOs, and pragmatic iteration.
* Ownership‑driven with a positive, proactive attitude; comfortable leading projects or learning from battle‑tested engineers.
* Experience operating services on Kubernetes and at least one major cloud (e.g., GCP, AWS, or Azure).
* Familiarity with event/streaming systems (e.g., Pub/Sub, Kafka), caching (e.g., Redis), and data stores for low‑latency paths.
* Practical understanding of LLM/agents building blocks: tool/function calling, structured outputs, streaming, and model selection/routing.
* Strong observability and debugging skills: tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry), metrics, dashboards, and production forensics.
* Background in one or more areas is a plus: policy/guardrails, multi‑tenant isolation, rate‑limiting, concurrency control, cost optimization.


**Location:**
* This role is hybrid (3\\-4 days a week in one of our SF Bay Area offices)


**Compensation \\& Benefits**
 The standard base salary range for this position is $170,000 \\- $265,000 annually. Compensation offered will be determined by factors such as location, level, job\\-related knowledge, skills, and experience. Certain roles may be eligible for variable compensation, equity, and benefits.

 Reducto helps AI teams ingest real world enterprise data with state of the art accuracy.
   

  

 The vast majority of enterprise data — from financial statements to health records — is locked in unstructured file formats like PDFs and spreadsheets. We train vision models to read those documents the way a human would, and make it possible to build products, train models, and automate processes at scale.
   

  

 We’ve grown incredibly quickly, growing revenue by 7x YOY, and now work with hundreds of companies ranging from leading AI teams (Harvey, Vanta, Scale), through to enterprise (FAANG, top 3 trading firm).
   

  

 We're raised over 100M from world class investors like A16z, Benchmark, and First Round Capital, and are hiring a Design Engineer.
   

  

 The Role
   

  

 As a Design Engineer, you'll own the development of Reducto Studio, our Next.js\\-based application that makes document parsing accessible to both technical and non\\-technical users. You'll work on everything from interactive document viewers to data extraction workflows, building delightful experiences that make complex AI capabilities feel simple.
   

  

**We Would Love To Meet You If You:**
* Philosophy: You are your own worst critic. You have a high bar for quality and don't rest until the job is done right—no settling for 90%. We want someone who ships fast, with high agency, and who doesn't just voice problems but actively jumps in to fix them.
* Experience: You have 2\\+ years of experience building real world frontend applications with modern frameworks
* Language/Skills: You're exceptional at TypeScript and React, with strong design sensibility. You understand both the technical and visual aspects of great product experiences.
* Tools: Build your own tools as needed—like a quick prototype to test a new interaction pattern or a component library to speed up development.
* Approach: A quantitative approach to building products. Ability to debug, experiment, and iterate fast. You should be comfortable getting hands\\-on with the full development lifecycle, from ideation to shipping to users.


**The Core Work Will Include:**
* Building and improving Reducto Studio's core features—document viewers, extraction workflows, data visualization, and editing interfaces
* Creating delightful, intuitive UIs for complex document parsing capabilities like form filling, table extraction, and structured data output
* Implementing real\\-time collaboration features and responsive interfaces that work seamlessly across devices
* Working within our design system and stack (Next.js, Tailwind, Convex) to ship fast while maintaining high quality
* Experimenting with new interaction patterns to make AI\\-powered document processing feel magical
* Working directly with the founders and customers to shape the product direction based on user feedback


**Bonus Points If You:**
* Have prior experience founding a company or building products at early stages
* Have experience with document viewers, PDF rendering, or complex data visualization
* Are ambitious and driven, and care a lot about doing great work with great people
* Keep up with the latest developments in frontend engineering and design systems


 This is an in person role at our office in SF. We're an early stage company which means that the role requires working hard and moving quickly. Please only apply if that excites you.
   

  

**About Reducto**
*Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs*
 PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that’s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn’t an inconvenience—it’s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.
   

  

*Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs*
 OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.
   

  

 Reducto Breaks Document Layouts Into Subsections And Then Contextually Parses Each Depending On The Type Of Content. This Is Made Possible By a Combination Of Vision Models, LLMs, And a Suite Of Heuristics We Built Over Time. Put Simply, We Can Help You:
   

  

* Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts
* Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents
* Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions
* Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto’s document metadata
* Intelligently chunk information using the document’s layout data


 Benefits at Reducto
   

  

*At Reducto, we’re invested in the well\\-being and growth of our team. Here’s what we currently offer:*
* Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging.
* Lunch: Receive a free lunch to eat with your teammates daily at the office
* Reimbursed Transportation: Provide us with your receipts and we’ll take care of the costs
* Insurance: Generous health insurance covering medical, dental, and vision.
* Health and Wellness Budget: We provide up to $150/mo reimbursement for health and wellness spending, such as gym memberships, fitness classes, or similar.
* Parental Leave: Work with us to build a leave schedule that works for you and your family
