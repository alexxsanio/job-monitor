 Over 1 million users across tens of thousands of teams rely on Tactiq to turn meeting conversations into exceptional outcomes. We're a Series A, Sydney\\-based SaaS company building AI note taker for Google Meet, Zoom, MS Teams.
 



 We're product\\-led growth in its purest form: individuals adopt → teams form organically → enterprises discover value → they come to us. A great product that users love. At the same time, we're a small, AI\\-enabled team. That means high leverage, high autonomy, and every decision matters and compounds.
   

  




**The Role**

 Join our product engineering team, where you'll be instrumental in creating new user\\-centric features and enhancing existing functionalities! You'll collaborate with product, marketing, and support teams to ensure seamless feature delivery.
 



 We need a Staff\\-level builder who pairs entrepreneurial drive with disciplined delivery to own company\\-level outcomes across a complex product and data surface.
 



 You will own outcomes, not tasks, and you will partner as a peer with senior PMs to shape roadmap and scope.
   

  




**This is NOT for you if...**
* You need task lists, extensive PM/EM direction, or weekly architecture approval rituals.
* Your impact tops out at a single service/team, or you primarily optimise for individual velocity.
* You prefer clean\\-room design over production constraints and fast feedback.


**What you'll do**
* Lead from ambiguity: turn messy, multi\\-constraint problems into executable and phased delivery. Clear requirements are a myth, but clear direction is not. It is also your job to make that ambiguity smaller.
* Make quick, high\\-leverage, and pragmatic decisions. If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right \\- thinking it through but not overengineering and blowing it out of proportion.
* Act as incident commander for hairy production issues; drive post\\-incident hardening and fixes. Not that incidents happen often \\- just when they do, it's urgent and important to avoid impacting too many users.
* Ship hands\\-on: design, code, review, and instrument \\- with AI\\-native tooling as the baseline, not the exception. It's not fun to move the buttons left and right or compare current loads to baselines \\- that would be the job for automated tools.


**How we work**
* High autonomy, low hierarchy; tight Product\\-Engineering loops. When we disagree, we dig down to the roots and find common ground, because we all want the same thing, in the end.
* We collaborate and support each other any time, all the time. There is always someone who can help, even if they will be acting as a rubber duck. We got your back \\- and you got ours.
* AI\\-accelerated engineering by default \\- but without blind trust in generated things. No matter the source, reviews and testing are reviews and testing. Using AI is not optional, but it's not a silver bullet.
* Modern tooling and constant progress. We put focused effort into getting best\\-in\\-class tools \\- and we change them if necessary as well, so sunk costs do not keep swimming with us.


**Requirements**
* Track record operating at staff\\-level scope in high\\-growth product companies.
* Deep systems thinking: data modelling, performance, reliability, platform boundaries, security by design.
* Elite execution under uncertainty: you ship material value without a ""requirements buffet.""
* Strong debugging and troubleshooting skills. Some problems are hard to reproduce, but that would never stop you.
* Strong communication skills for effective interaction with technical and non\\-technical colleagues.
* Proven capability to own the delivery of complex features from product design through to production support.
* Pragmatism in choosing solutions and flexibility in adjusting along the way.
* Resourcefulness in finding minimal but viable solutions to new requirements.
* A commitment to delivering high\\-quality, stable code with frequent releases.
* Curiosity in finding and experimenting with new technologies and tools.
* Hot burning passion to ship software to hundreds of thousands and millions of user to change their lives.


**Benefits**
**Why Join Tactiq**
* **Leverage:** 
 Small AI\\-enabled team \\= 10x the impact of a traditional engineering role.
* **Ownership:** 
 You'll own product domain areas end\\-to\\-end.
* **Scale:** 
 1M\\+ users, pure PLG, bottom\\-up motion. This is PLG at its best.
* **Learning:** 
 Work directly with founders who obsess over data, experimentation, and exceptional execution.
* **Impact:** 
 Every experiment you run, every feature you ship, every colored pixel you build matters immediately.
* **Flexibility:** 
 Remote\\-friendly, autonomy\\-first culture. We trust you to do your best work.


**Our Values**
* **Build what is right for the customer:** 
 We move from customer feedback to customer outcomes ASAP.
* **Ship fast but thoughtfully:** 
 We look ahead, but deliver every day. Outcomes over activity.
* **Data\\-driven decision making:** 
 We use rigorous analytical thinking. Data informs, intuition guides.
* **Autonomy allows us to do our best work:** 
 We work independently, collaborate in small teams, and keep noise minimal.
* **Transparency, trust, empathy:** 
 We communicate clearly, share openly, and elevate each other.
* **Measured growth drives long\\-term success:** 
 We don't grow for growth's sake. We organise ourselves to bring out the best in our people and focus on what customers need.","Software Development","https://au.linkedin.com/company/tactiqhq","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQEp-VUfB3_O4w/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630662927719/tactiqhq_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=HU6f6niVH7L-Q8-IGzDlIYgmaVf0fajkSeGK12p8ci4","","","","","","","","","","",""

 At any given time, 16 million Americans are experiencing a crisis that requires urgent help from our legal system or government. The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it.
   

  

 Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life\\-changing aid they deserve. In the last six years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life\\-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.
   

  

 We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 16,000\\+ five\\-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well\\-funded for the foreseeable future.) In 2025, our team grew from 151 to 210, and we expect to grow again in 2026\\.
   

  

**The Job**
 Atticus works in an industry dominated by outdated technology that is ripe for fresh thinking: our core competitors rely on massive call centers to screen clients, antiquated CRMs to track and manage cases, and paper checks to get paid (provided they’re sent to the right address).
   

  

 Conversely, as a VC\\-backed tech company our product \\& engineering department powers everything we do: from creating an engaging online experience for people in crisis to providing tools for our network lawyers as they serve our clients, Atticus relies on technology to fulfill our mission.
   

  

 We’re looking for Software Engineers to join our team. You’ll work on the front\\-end and back\\-end, and will partner with every department at Atticus as we continue to grow our platform to help people in need find trusted legal support.
   

  

**What You'll Do:**
* Design, build and operate Atticus’ web applications with a focus on performance, modularity, extensibility, and reliability.
* Work with product to evaluate and refine product details and acceptance criteria
* Architect, design, write, review, and test code in a collaborative environment with other software engineers.
* Evaluate storage technologies and methodologies with an eye toward scalability and performance.
* Leverage your peers as multipliers for your skills to create excellent products and services.


 The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast\\-growing Series C startup that doubles as a B\\-corp social enterprise. Every project you take on will help clients in need get the help they deserve, and you’ll shape our company culture as we scale. We’re looking for engineers who are excited about our mission and the challenges it entails.
   

  

**Qualifications**
 Required:
   

  

* You have 3\\+ years of experience writing idiomatic JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, Scala, or Ruby.
* You have experience and love for building performant React applications
* You speak CSS and HTML fluently and know how to build around browser limitations
* You enjoy working with UI and UX experts to build compelling user experiences
* You build modern, resilient and operationally sane fullstack systems exemplifying industry standards (HTTP REST, GraphQL, Stream processing, Big Data).
* You enjoy teaching and mentoring teammates on backend system best practices and architecture
* You work well with product to clarify and translate requirements for teammates
* You use a modern version\\-control system for your source code repository (Git, Mercurial, GitHub, BitBucket).
* You lint all your code or know you should.
* You know what parts of your code require tests and you write those tests.
* You use objective judgment in leveraging the right frameworks and technologies.
* You are versed in cloud computing systems (GCP, AWS, etc.) and SAAS concepts.
* You leverage continuous integration systems to their full extent (CircleCI, Bamboo, Jenkins, TravisCI).
* You plan for, build, evolve and scrutinize monitoring and alerting for your production systems.
* You are willing and able to deploy, troubleshoot, and maintain your systems in production and staging environments.


**Bonus / Nice\\-to\\-Have:**
* Experience with Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, CircleCI, Git, Golang, Java
* Experience with GraphQL, GraphQL Federation, REST APIs and supporting network protocols
* Experience with a distributed SQL platform like CockroachDB or Google Spanner
* Experience with Hadoop, MapReduce, or other “Big Data” systems
* You can build a great Webpack configuration


 We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.
   

  

**Salary And Benefits**
 This is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well\\-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.
   

  

 We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.
   

  

 We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:
   

  

* Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered
* 15 vacation days \\& \\~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at end\\-of\\-year)
* Free membership to OneMedical

 If you have read my job descriptions in the past, you will recognize how I write job descriptions. If you are new, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom Welke. I am Partner \\& VP at RSM Solutions, Inc and I have been recruiting technical talent for more than 23 years and been in the tech space since the 1990s. Due to this, I actually write JD's myself...no AI, no 'bots', just a real live human. I realized a while back that looking for work is about as fun as a root canal with no anesthesia...especially now. So, rather than saying 'must work well with others' and 'team mindset', I do away with that kind of nonsense and just tell it like it is.
 



  





 So, as with every role I work on, social fit is almost as important as technical fit. For this one, technical fit is very very important. But, we also have some social fit characteristics that are important. This is the kind of place that requires people to dive in and learn. The hiring manager for this one is actually a very dear friend of mine. He said something interesting to me not all that long ago. He mentioned, if you aren't spending at least an hour a day learning something new, you really are doing yourself a disservice. This is that classic environment where no one says 'this is not my job'. So that ability to jump in and help is needed for success in this role.
 



  





 This role is being done onsite in Irvine, California. I prefer working with candidates that are already local to the area. If you need to relocate, that is fine, but there are no relocation dollars available.
 



  





 I can only work with US Citizens or Green Card Holders for this role. I cannot work with H1, OPT, EAD, F1, H4, or anyone that is not already a US Citizen or Green Card Holder for this role.
 



  





 The Data Engineer role is similar to the Data Integration role I posted. However, this one is mor Ops focused, with the orchestration of deployment and ML flow, and including orchestrating and using data on the clusters and managing how the models are performing. This role focuses on coding \\& configuring on the ML side of the house.
 



  





 You will be designing, automating, and observing end to end data pipelines that feed this client's Kubeflow driven machine learning platform, ensuring models are trained, deployed, and monitored on trustworthy, well governed data. You will build batch/stream workflows, wire them into Azure DevOps CI/CD, and surface real time health metrics in Prometheus \\+ Grafana dashboards to guarantee data availability. The role bridges Data Engineering and MLOps, allowing data scientists to focus on experimentation and the business sees rapid, reliable predictive insight.
 



  





 Here are some of the main responsibilities:
 


* Design and implement batch and streaming pipelines in Apache Spark running on Kubernetes and Kubeflow Pipelines to hydrate feature stores and training datasets.
* Build high throughput ETL/ELT jobs with SSIS, SSAS, and T SQL against MS SQL Server, applying Data Vault style modeling patterns for auditability.
* Integrate source control, build, and release automation using GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps for every pipeline component.
* Instrument pipelines with Prometheus exporters and visualize SLA, latency, and error budget metrics to enable proactive alerting.
* Create automated data quality and schema drift checks; surface anomalies to support a rapid incident response process.
* Use MLflow Tracking and Model Registry to version artifacts, parameters, and metrics for reproducible experiments and safe rollbacks.
* Work with data scientists to automate model retraining and deployment triggers within Kubeflow based on data freshness or concept drift signals.
* Develop PowerShell and .NET utilities to orchestrate job dependencies, manage secrets, and publish telemetry to Azure Monitor.
* Optimize Spark and SQL workloads through indexing, partitioning, and cluster sizing strategies, benchmarking performance in CI pipelines.
* Document lineage, ownership, and retention policies; ensure pipelines conform to PCI/SOX and internal data governance standards.



  





 Here is what we are seeking:
 


* At least 6 years of experience building data pipelines in Spark or equivalent.
* At least 2 years deploying workloads on Kubernetes/Kubeflow.
* At least 2 years of experience with MLflow or similar experiment‑tracking tools.
* At least 6 years of experience in T‑SQL, Python/Scala for Spark.
* At least 6 years of PowerShell/.NET scripting.
* At least 6 years of experience with with GitHub, Azure DevOps, Prometheus, Grafana, and SSIS/SSAS.
* Kubernetes CKA/CKAD, Azure Data Engineer (DP‑203\\), or MLOps‑focused certifications (e.g., Kubeflow or MLflow) would be great to see.
* Mentor engineers on best practices in containerized data engineering and MLOps.","Manufacturing and Retail Apparel and Fashion","https://www.linkedin.com/company/rsm-solutions-inc","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQG5xNX3vjvKbA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630618315922/rsm_solutions_inc_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ouPN5lBhVVUl0WXp8VJYE0qoxMQdKhoO02mA3oyKl08","","","","","","","","","","",""
