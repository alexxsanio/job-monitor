 We’re creating an entirely new payments platform, built with stablecoins, to simplify global money movement. Bridge enables faster, cheaper payments and borderless access to dollars via stablecoins. Through our APIs, businesses can send and receive funds across borders faster / cheaper vs. SWIFT and other fiat\\-only rails. Our virtual accounts enable international consumers and businesses to easily access, store and spend US dollars. Our payouts infrastructure enables platforms to disburse USD to anyone globally. We believe many trillions of dollars will move and settle through stablecoin payment rails. Bridge is pulling this future forward.
   

  

 We have a small team of people who have previously built financial infrastructure at some of the world’s leading companies (Coinbase, Stripe, Square, Brex, Upstart, DoorDash, Airbnb) and each and every one of them chose Bridge because they fundamentally believe that stablecoins will be a critical piece of financial infrastructure that allows for the improvement of global money movement.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As an early member of the Bridge engineering team, you will be given the autonomy to work on projects that are truly global in scale and aim to give customers access to products they've never had access to. Many of the use cases that we work on today didn't exist several months ago and that's because our team is dedicated to constant improvement for our partners and end users. Our Engineers have outsized ownership over projects so if you are looking for increased autonomy working on a completely greenfield opportunity, Bridge is the place for you.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Ship software to build out our suite of API products. We’re an engineering and API\\-first company, and you will learn first\\-hand and contribute towards building highly reliable, performant, and mission critical infrastructure serving thousands of developers across the globe.
* Take sole ownership of projects, oftentimes without the support of Product Management, and liaise both internally with teams like Legal/Compliance and externally with our partners and developers.
* Look for constant improvements to our product offerings with the explicit goal of improving the experience for our partners and end users.
* Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation.
* Improve engineering standards, tooling and processes for the team and our broader org.


**Qualifications**
* We are open to hiring engineers at various levels of seniority (SWE through Senior Staff) but at a minimum we are looking for somebody with 5\\+ years of experience.
* Experience building backend systems with SQL databases. Experience with frameworks such as Rails, Django, Express or equivalent is a bonus.
* An enlarged sense of ownership and the ability to lead and influence the design and direction of our products.
* An ability to thrive in a fast paced environment.
* A growth mindset and a constant curiosity and fearlessness to dive into the unknown.
* An ability to write maintainable, well\\-tested, modular code, but also be pragmatic about moving fast.
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to write clear technical documentation.
* Past experience working on crypto or financial products a plus, and while not required, we do look for people who are very passionate about building in this space.
* Experience with building API products a plus, but not required.
* Experience working with blockchain or distributed systems a big plus


 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in\\-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in\\-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
   

  

 Pay and benefits
   

  

 The annual US base salary range for this role is $187,500 \\- $281,300\\. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

**About The Role**
 We’re looking for a
 **Full\\-Stack Engineer** 
 with strong
 **backend and DevOps background** 
 to help build and evolve internal tools that power AI research and evaluation. This role sits at the intersection of backend architecture, infrastructure automation, and developer experience — with the larger goal of improving how we measure and ensure the quality and safety of AI systems.You’ll collaborate closely with
 **machine\\-learning researchers, data scientists, PMs, and engineers** 
 , translating complex research workflows into robust, scalable systems. While your primary focus will be on backend services, data models, and infrastructure, you’ll also occasionally contribute to
 **frontend development** 
 to help shape cohesive, user\\-friendly interfaces that bring research workflows to life.
 **What You’ll Work On**
* Designing and implementing backend APIs and data models using modern web frameworks (e.g. Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Node.js / Adonis, or Python / FastAPI)
* Managing MongoDB schemas and performing safe data migrations for live research datasets
* Building and maintaining Dockerized applications and CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes / Argo CD environments
* Maintaining and versioning APIs and SDKs following Semantic Versioning (SemVer), and communicating updates clearly to internal users
* Working directly with internal customers to understand workflows, gather requirements, and translate them into actionable engineering tasks
* Automating developer processes and improving tooling and developer experience across the platform
* Occasionally contributing to frontend development (React or similar frameworks) to integrate new backend features or streamline researcher\\-facing workflows


**What You Bring**
* Strong backend development experience with at least one modern web framework (Laravel, Rails, Node.js / Adonis, or Python / FastAPI)
* Proficiency with Docker and containerized application development
* Experience with MongoDB and schema evolution in production environments
* Familiarity with Kubernetes, Argo CD, or similar DevOps platforms
* Understanding of CI/CD, API versioning, and SDK publishing workflows
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills — comfortable engaging with internal users, clarifying requirements, and turning feedback into practical solutions
* A customer\\-first mindset and enthusiasm for improving internal tooling and developer experience
* A strong work ethic, eagerness to learn new systems and technologies, and the ability to connect disparate tools and architectures into cohesive solutions
* An open, reflective approach — you learn from past experiences without being biased toward past solutions
* Bonus: experience or curiosity in machine\\-learning evaluation, data visualization, Amazon S3, or authentication and security best practices


**Why This Role Matters**
 You’ll help bridge the gap between
 **research and engineering** 
 , enabling teams to evaluate and iterate on AI models more efficiently and responsibly. Your work will directly contribute to improving the
 **quality, reliability, and safety of AI systems** 
 — not by training models, but by building the infrastructure that helps everyone understand them better.This is an opportunity to shape the tools that shape research itself — within a small, collaborative team that values thoughtful design, experimentation, and real\\-world impact.

 Data protection needs for large enterprises are evolving into a varied usage of private/public clouds. While Rubrik has built incredibly successful solutions for both, our technical architecture needs to constantly evolve to fit our customers needs, working seamlessly across public/private clouds. To provide the same magical experience to our customers while maintaining the agility of a startup, we need to converge our solutions on a foundation that can be extended \\& re\\-used. This requires continuous rethink across many areas of product and stack.
   

  

 At the heart of Rubrik’s architecture is an open\\-source scalable, distributed SQL database. This is a fundamental building block and the metadata repository for all infrastructure components (e.g. distributed file system) and applications (e.g. Oracle db backup) in Rubrik’s stack. Because of its central role, the performance, scalability, and availability demands from this component are continually increasing.
   

  

 In addition, we are rethinking the APIs \\& interactions of this layer in order to continue building our infra for new and varied use cases for the public \\& private cloud. Being at the core of the stack, this layer (and the team) needs to provide guidance for all software layers above it (e.g., file system, reporting, UI) to transition smoothly.

* Design \\& Develop: Take end\\-to\\-end ownership of features—from drafting design documents and coding to testing and deployment in production.
* Solve Scale Challenges: Work on complex problems related to data integrity, high\\-throughput systems, concurrency, and security.
* Collaborate: Work closely with Product Managers, UX Designers, and senior engineers through detailed code reviews and architectural discussions.
* Grow \\& Learn: Participate in our structured mentorship program designed to help you rapidly scale your technical skills and navigate your career path.


 Experience you’ll need
   

  

**Qualifications**
* 1\\-2 years of experience
* Experience in programming languages such as Go, Java, Python
* Strong understanding and interest in large\\-scale, distributed systems design and development
* Bachelor’s and/or Master’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Familiarity with current cloud technologies
* Coursework or project experience with Distributed Systems, Networking, File Systems, or Operating System internals.
* Familiarity with Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) or virtualization technologies.
* Experience with using open source software in critical areas.


 The minimum and maximum base salaries for this role are posted below; additionally, the role is eligible for bonus potential, equity and benefits. The range displayed reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire salaries for the role based on U.S. location. Within the range, the salary offered will be determined by work location and additional factors, including job\\-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training.

* Testing and Deployment: contribute UI tests/e2e smoke tests; add observability (front\\-end metrics, logs, etc), and help in building a comprehensive networking test bed for the system..


**What You’ll Bring**
* Experience building and maintaining production\\-scale web applications, ideally using modern frameworks like React or similar component\\-based ecosystems
* Strong fluency in JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and Node.js
* Hands\\-on experience designing real\\-time dashboards, observability or admin tools that surface live data \\- comfortable working with streaming APIs, WebSockets, or adaptive polling strategies for low\\-latency updates.

* Rust fluency \\- familiarity with Axum, gRPC, and websockets/SSE
* Strong product sensibility for complex, technical UIs — able to translate ambiguous requirements into intuitive workflows, communicate trade\\-offs, and design low\\-code or configurable interfaces that serve both technical and non\\-technical users.


**Nice to Have**
* Solid grasp of cloud\\-native infrastructure — containerization with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment to AWS.
* Familiarity with advanced data visualization for rendering complex telemetry or analytics data.
* Experience building or integrating real\\-time data pipelines, event\\-driven systems, or messaging (e.g., with Kafka Redis Streams).

* Humility: Strong opinions, loosely held. Change your mind with facts. Teach and learn in the open; celebrate team wins over heroics.
* Initiative: Run toward the smoke. Own problems end\\-to\\-end.

 Retell AI is using the first principles to reimagine the call center with cutting edge voice AI.
   

  

 We believe voice is still the most natural way humans communicate, yet it has been trapped in outdated call centers for decades. Our mission is to bring intelligence, empathy, and speed to every phone conversation between businesses and their customers.
   

  

 Since launching 18 months ago, thousands of companies now utilize Retell’s AI voice agents to handle sales, support, and logistics calls that once required large teams of human agents. Backed by Y Combinator, Altman Capital, and other leading investors, we have scaled to $30M ARR with a team of 20 people, up from $5M at the start of 2025\\.
   

  

 Now, we’re scaling fast, and we’re looking for bold, ambitious people to help us build the gold standard for voice automation.

 Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.
   

  

 In\\-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in\\-office workdays.
   

  

**About The Role**
 The Monetization team makes it simple and trustworthy for customers to purchase and grow with Notion. Our work spans billing infrastructure, pricing and packaging, AI usage‑based billing, and the experiences that help customers understand what they pay for.
   

  

 We’re looking for an experienced software engineer to be a technical leader on the Monetization team. You’ll focus on the foundations of how Notion charges customers: plans, entitlements, payments, invoices, and AI usage. You will work closely with product, design, finance, data, and go‑to‑market partners to ship changes that are both technically sound and business‑critical.
   

  

 This is a great role if you enjoy hard systems problems (correctness, performance, reliability) and also like seeing your work show up directly in how customers buy and use a product.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Design and evolve the architecture for Notion’s billing and pricing systems so we can launch new plans, add‑ons, and AI usage models without repeated rewrites
* Own end‑to‑end projects that touch multiple systems and teams, from early technical design through rollout and iteration
* Improve the reliability, observability, and correctness of our monetization flows (for example, preventing double‑billing, missed invoices, or quota drift)
* Partner with product and business stakeholders to turn ambiguous monetization ideas into clear technical plans and shipping milestones
* Help other engineers grow by reviewing designs and code, sharing best practices, and setting a high bar for craft on the team


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Significant experience building and operating complex backend systems in production
* Strong skills in system design, data modeling, and working with transactional, correctness‑sensitive domains
* A track record of leading projects that required coordination across multiple teams or stakeholders
* Clear, empathetic communication with both technical and non‑technical partners
* A bias toward simple, robust solutions over clever ones, and comfort working in an evolving product area like pricing and billing


**Nice To Haves**
* Experience with payments, billing, or usage‑based pricing is a plus, but not required—strong engineers who are excited about this space can ramp quickly.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures.

You’ll work across distributed systems, production observability, and ML infra integrations to deliver an experience that feels instant, accurate, and trustworthy — while optimizing cost and reliability.
   

  

**You Will**
* Own impactful runtime problems end‑to‑end — from architecture and design to production launch and ongoing reliability.
* Build and evolve core services for session lifecycle, streaming responses (e.g., gRPC/WebSockets), structured tool execution, memory/state, and policy/guardrails.
* Design for performance, correctness, and cost: reduce p50/p95 latency, improve tail behavior, and optimize token/tool budgets.
* Integrate with leading LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) and internal evaluation frameworks to improve quality and predictability.
* Harden the platform with fault isolation, retries, timeouts, circuit‑breaking, backpressure, and graceful degradation.
* Instrument deep observability (tracing, metrics, logs) and create playbooks/SLOs for high availability and on‑call excellence.
* Collaborate closely with product, quality, and application teams to prioritize the most impactful roadmap investments.


**You Are**
* 3\\+ years of software engineering experience building production distributed systems or cloud‑native applications.
* BS/BA in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience.
* Strong coding skills in at least one of: Python, Go, Java, or C\\+\\+, with a focus on reliability, performance, and tests.
* Product‑minded: you prioritize customer impact, clear SLAs/SLOs, and pragmatic iteration.
* Ownership‑driven with a positive, proactive attitude; comfortable leading projects or learning from battle‑tested engineers.
* Experience operating services on Kubernetes and at least one major cloud (e.g., GCP, AWS, or Azure).
* Familiarity with event/streaming systems (e.g., Pub/Sub, Kafka), caching (e.g., Redis), and data stores for low‑latency paths.
* Practical understanding of LLM/agents building blocks: tool/function calling, structured outputs, streaming, and model selection/routing.
* Strong observability and debugging skills: tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry), metrics, dashboards, and production forensics.
* Background in one or more areas is a plus: policy/guardrails, multi‑tenant isolation, rate‑limiting, concurrency control, cost optimization.

We're backed by the biggest names in entertainment including Sofia Vergara, Karol G, Tommy Mottola, and Tier 1 VCs like Point72 Ventures. We're not building for hypothetical use cases. We're shipping production AI that drives millions in revenue today.
   

  

**Why we'll win:** 
 We have what no one else has: both the data and the distribution. We have proprietary data on thousands of influencers and what makes content go viral, plus direct relationships with the influencers themselves. In the AI era, having both is the moat. Everyone else has one or the other. We have both.
   

  

**Why now:** 
 AGI agents will replace middle level work by 2027\\. We have a 12 to 18 month window before the market floods with agents. We're building the category defining social media viral agent right now.
   

  

**What we're looking for:** 
 Young talent ready to go all in. We're offering significant equity to people who want to build something that matters. This isn't a job. It's an opportunity to define the future of AI in influencer marketing and own a meaningful piece of it.

If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.
   

  

 Slack is your Digital HQ – a place where work flows between your people, systems, partners, and customers. From Fortune 100 companies to corner markets, millions of people around the world use Slack to connect their teams, unify their systems, and drive their business forward.
   

  

 Slack breaks down communication silos inside and beyond your organization by bringing teams and tools together around common goals, projects and processes in channels and in Slack Connect. It removes the limits of physical walls, giving people the flexibility to do their best work where, when and how they prefer with features like huddles and clips. And it empowers everyone to automate common tasks with apps and workflows. In this digital\\-first era, Slack’s mission is to make people’s work lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive.
   

  

**About The Team**
 This role is on the Quip team, part of the Slack productivity organization. The Quip Product \\& Services team is responsible for all parts of the user and admin facing Quip platform, as well as the Quip APIs. Quip is also the backbone of Slack Canvas. At Quip our priorities are multi pronged: first and foremost we preserve our customer's love and trust by continuing to provide them with the reliable, secure Quip suite they've come to love and depend on over many years to do their work every day. We do that by thoughtfully investing in long term initiatives to harden all parts of the Quip platform while proactively pursuing opportunities to reduce operational and maintenance costs of the platform. Secondly, we leverage our special and longstanding customer relationships and trove of data to identify the most helpful productivity use cases and use that knowledge to guide the design and product development of some of Slack's productivity features.
   

  

 We are looking for Fullstack Engineers to build features, design and implement API methods, and improve the performance and reliability of our systems as we rapidly scale our product and organization. We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including TypeScript, PHP/Hack, and Python. Expertise in these areas is a huge plus, but having familiarity with other common web languages (such as Java or Ruby) and other relational databases are fine substitutes. We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross\\-functional team of product managers, designers, frontend, iOS, Android, automation, and quality engineers to make Slack a better product. We are looking for engineers that understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.
   

  

 Quip Product \\& Services team is responsible for all Quip client apps and the API platform.
   

  

 Slack Productivity suite includes Lists, Huddles, Canvas and Templates, helping organizations consolidate their work in one place.
   

  

 Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?
   

  

**What you will be doing:**
* You’ll brainstorm with Product Managers, Designers, Backend, and Frontend Engineers on your team to conceptualize and build new features for our large (and growing!) user base.
* You’ll produce high\\-quality results by contributing heavily to team projects that have a significant impact on the business.
* You’ll actively own team features or systems and define their long\\-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
* You’ll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving production issues.
* You’ll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
* You’ll improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.


**What you should have:**
* You’ve been building web applications professionally for 5\\+ years.
* You have experience with full stack development in TypeScript or JavaScript. Python, PHP/Hack is a bonus!
* You can contribute to technical architecture discussions and help drive technical decisions within your team.
* You write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
* You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.

 Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing. 
 




  






 We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it. 
 




  






 Engineers make million\\-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI\\-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non\\-destructively. 
 




  






 We rebuilt the whole system, from X\\-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web\\-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again. 
 




  






 Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA.
 




  






**About the role:** 





  






 The Product Engineering Intern will join Lumafield’s Product team to prototype and ship experimental software that brings 3D data to life. You’ll build full\\-stack web applications and interactive visualizations that help engineers and designers interact with complex volumetric data, explore new product ideas, and shape the next generation of Lumafield’s user experience.
 




  






 This is a hands\\-on, creative internship for a
 
**“vibe coder”
 
 — someone who codes not just to make things work, but to make them feel right. You’ll work in a rapid prototyping environment where curiosity, polish, and playfulness matter as much as technical skill.
 

  






 Ideal for a
 
**junior or senior year student
 
 studying computer science, applied mathematics, design engineering, or a related field who’s excited by the intersection of data, design, and storytelling.
 


  




**What you'll do:** 
* Prototype and ship interactive web applications for scientific and 3D data visualization.
* Build internal tools and dashboards that accelerate development, analysis, and customer insight.
* Collaborate with designers and engineers to bring data to life through expressive UI and intuitive interactivity.
* Integrate AI\\-assisted tools to speed up development and experimentation.
* Curate and visualize test datasets to support algorithm benchmarking and user testing.
* Explore and experiment with graphics, rendering, and WebGL/WebGPU frameworks to make scientific data accessible and delightful.



  




**About you:** 
* You are a product\\-minded engineer with a strong sense of aesthetic and user empathy
* You’ve built and deployed full\\-stack apps (React, Next.js, Node, Python/FastAPI, or similar)
* You’re comfortable with modern web visualization frameworks (Three.js, D3\\.js, Deck.gl, Plotly, etc.)
* You use AI tools as creative amplifiers, not just productivity hacks
* You can communicate visually — through code, mockups, or sketches
* You prioritize speed and learning over polish when prototyping
* You’re curious, playful, and obsessed with how things look and feel



  




**Bonus points for:** 
* A portfolio or GitHub showcasing interactive or creative coding projects.
* Experience with 3D rendering, scientific visualization, or computational geometry.
* Familiarity with data\\-driven storytelling or creative coding tools (Processing, p5\\.js, TouchDesigner, etc.)
* Experience working with scientific or physical datasets (e.g. simulation, imaging, or CAD)
* A genuine interest in the intersection of science, design, and technology.






  




  



 This role will be performed alongside a cohort of Lumafield summer interns and is a paid position. We also offer relocation assistance if you are out\\-of\\-state. We do not currently offer visa sponsorship or OPT eligibility.
 




  






 Lumafield is committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, because the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Do you feel like your skills don’t meet every single requirement listed? We encourage you to apply anyway – If you’re excited about our technology, the opportunity, and are eager to learn more we’d love to hear from you!  
 




  






 In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information or veteran status.
