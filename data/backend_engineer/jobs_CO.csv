Here’s what they said.**
 At most companies, engineers wait.
   

  

 Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.
   

  

 At Jerry.ai, we don’t wait.
   

  

 If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it — sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us:
 ***“At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.”***
 That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you’ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior — sometimes the same week they ship.
 ***“Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,”***
 said another.
 ***“And things move fast.”***
 We don’t do bureaucracy. We don’t do politics. Everyone here — from our CTO to our tech leads — writes code and sweats the details.
 ***“The leaders here lead by example,”***
 one teammate shared.
 ***“They have very high standards. They don’t settle for just OK.”***
 It’s challenging work, but it’s meaningful. You’ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You’ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly:
 ***“I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.”***
 We’re a remote\\-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.
   

  

**So, what is** 
**Jerry.ai** 
**and why should you care?🤔**
 Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you’ll ever own — and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we’re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we’re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion\\+ problem and we’re the only company tackling it end\\-to\\-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next.
   

  

**What You’ll Work On**
* Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end\\-to\\-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage.
* Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1–2 weeks on average.
* Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules.
* Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re\\-shopping experiences.
* Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in\\-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero.
* Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention.
* Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack.
* Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture.


**Our Tech Stack**
* Frontend \\& backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo
* API: GraphQL
* Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda
* Our business has grown more complex over time. We’re refactoring major parts of our code base — simplifying old systems, rebuilding core flows, and setting up the next three years of our platform’s growth. You’ll help build the foundation for that next phase.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Experience: At least 2 years full stack engineering experience building production\\-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast\\-growing consumer\\-facing software
* Technical strength: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than prior experience with our tech stack.
* Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.
* Ownership: You take responsibility for end\\-to\\-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.
* Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills.
* Curiosity \\+ adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.


 This isn’t another coding job.
 **You’ll work in a flexible** 
 , fast\\-moving, and
 **highly** 
**collaborative** 
**culture** 
 , where
 **innovation** 
**is** 
**encouraged** 
 ,
 **your voice is heard** 
 , and the
 **impact of your work is immediate** 
 . You’ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn, and grow alongside talented peers.

 So, if you are talented, driven, creative, and eager to join a dynamic, globally\\-connected team, then we want to talk!
   

  

**What you'll do:**
* This is a Senior Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) position, responsible for the reliability, performance, and efficiency of The Trade Desk systems and applications. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering reliable infrastructure and tools for our clients, partners, and employees.
* The Trade Desk infrastructure is “hybrid” both in operating system (Linux, Windows) and environment (bare metal, cloud). An SRE should be well rounded and “technology agnostic” with a pragmatic approach towards the best tool for the situation. You will have the opportunity to support thousands of hosts throughout the world, with petabyte\\-scale data challenges.
* Participating in an agile methodology, you will work closely with your teammates to monitor capacity, replace manual workflows with tools/automation, and evangelize scalable long\\-term solutions to technical problems.


**Who you are:**
* You have a passion for efficient operations. You’ve made significant contributions to large and impactful technical projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
* You can code. At our scale we are not interested in “boutique” manual management of servers and software. This is an engineer position, not an administrator or operator. You code with languages such as C\\#, Python, Go, Powershell, or Ruby. When a problem needs a software solution, you roll up your sleeves and get to work.
* You design for scale. You manage cattle, not pets. In other words, you understand that the only way to scale is to avoid special snowflakes of systems and applications. You design systems to auto\\-scale and auto\\-heal. Via automation, you relentlessly strive to eliminate manual toil.
* You are a broadly skilled engineer with an interest in service reliability, automation, monitoring, and/or capacity planning. But you have the breadth of knowledge necessary to support a wide variety of software and systems.
* You understand modern architectures. You know why Docker and containers are more than just buzzwords, but you are cautious against overcomplexity and overengineering. You are able to use traditional configuration management such as Chef, Ansible, or Terraform as well as modern infrastructure schedulers like Kubernetes and Mesos. You enjoy working with the latest monitoring and metrics platforms such as Prometheus.
* You are comfortable working on physical gear or in the cloud. Our hybrid environment requires objective knowledge of infrastructure, equally comfortable with traditional, physical servers as well as the software abstractions present in cloud platforms such as AWS.
* You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly\\-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade\\-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. You often have strong opinions but weakly held.
* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.


*The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk.
