**The Team \\& Role**
 We're the crew behind the software that makes our smart thermostats work. On the cloud side, everything runs in AWS, where we handle the updates and data flow. On the device side, we've built the Ebox in Python — it talks to the cloud on one end and to the thermostat on the other.
   

  

 Together, that setup keeps things running smoothly with live updates back and forth. On top of that, we also run the customer website, where people can log in, see what's going on with their thermostat, and tweak their energy settings.
   

  

 In short: cloud, Ebox, and the customer site — we build and support the whole experience.
