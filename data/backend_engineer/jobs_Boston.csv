 Full\\-time
   

  

**Description**
**About Us**
 We’re building the first fully automated cannabis co\\-packing platform — integrating robotics, production, data, and compliance into a system that scales. Our mission is to define the infrastructure layer for one of the fastest\\-growing industries in the world.
   

  

 This role is not about incremental improvements. It’s about creating the digital backbone of our business. You’ll be the one architecting the system that brings automation, compliance, and scale under one roof.
   

  

 As the
 **System Architect** 
 , you will own the design and build of our integrated operating platform — the system that connects customers, production, compliance, quality, and finance in real time. This isn’t a role where you inherit legacy systems. You’ll be setting the foundation that drives throughput, quality, and data visibility across the business.
   

  

 We’re looking for someone who thrives in the 0?1 stage: technically brilliant, pragmatic in execution, and obsessed with creating systems that scale. This is a role with direct line\\-of\\-sight to CTO as we grow.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Architect and implement the company’s core operating system, and scale into ERP\\-grade infrastructure.
* Build automation and integrations across manufacturing equipment, production processes, QA systems, finance, compliance (Metrc), CRM/ERP tools, and other data systems to create a seamless digital stack.
* Translate complex manufacturing workflows into software that frontline operators can actually use.
* Create data pipelines and dashboards that give executives machine\\-level visibility into scheduling, order tracking, throughput, cost, and performance.
* Lead system design decisions that balance speed, scalability, and security.


**Requirements**
**What You Bring**
* Engineering excellence: background in software, systems, or data engineering with a track record of building real products (not just prototypes).
* Systems mindset: ability to connect hardware, software, and operations into a cohesive platform.
* Startup velocity: experience working in environments where speed and iteration matter more than corporate process.
* Pragmatism: strong instincts for when to ship fast vs. when to engineer for scale.
* Communication: ability to work directly with operators, executives, and partners to translate business needs into technical systems.
* Curiosity: comfort diving into new domains — from robotics to compliance software — and figuring out how to stitch them together.


**Why This Role Matters**
 The cannabis industry has limited standardized infrastructure. Many operators are still cobbling together manual systems. By building the first scalable digital backbone for automated co\\-packing, you’ll define how our company operates for the next decade.
   

  

 This is a career\\-defining role: the systems you build here won’t just scale one company; they’ll set the standard for an entire sector.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

 and
 **troubleshooting** 
 to
 **fleet management analytics** 
 and
 **expert guidance** 
 from internal knowledge.
   

  

**About Us**
 Onto Innovation is a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of defect inspection, advanced packaging lithography, process control metrology, and data analysis systems and software used by semiconductor device manufacturers worldwide. Onto Innovation provides a full\\-fab solution through its families of proprietary products that provide critical yield\\-enhancing information and real time process control responses, enabling microelectronic device manufacturers to drive down the costs and time to market of their products. The Company’s expanding portfolio of equipment and software solutions is used in both the wafer processing and final manufacturing of ICs, and in adjacent markets such as FPD, and LED manufacturing.
   

  

 What you’ll do
   

  

* Prototype AI assistants \\& agents for field workflows: guided recipe setup, log triage, playbook lookups, parts/alarms advice, and fleet\\-wide health checks.
* Build retrieval systems (RAG): ingest manuals, specs, ticket notes, recipes, logs, and best\\-practice docs; design chunking, embeddings, and indexing; tune prompts and retrieval for accuracy/latency.
* Connect AI to our tools and data: stand up MCP servers (Model Context Protocol) and other connectors to safely expose internal systems (document stores, MES, issue trackers, telemetry APIs) to LLMs.
* Fine\\-tune or adapt models (e.g., LoRA/QLoRA) for domain terms, error codes, and tool\\-specific intents when retrieval alone isn’t enough.
* Evaluate and harden: set up offline \\& online evals for groundedness/relevance; add guardrails, observability, and traceability; write runbooks.
* Ship small apps: package prototypes behind simple APIs or lightweight UIs that field engineers can use (web chat, Slack/Teams bots, or CLI).
* Data plumbing: parse messy PDFs/images/CSVs; normalize schemas for recipes, events, alarms, SPC/trace data.
* Computer Vision – understanding, defect detection, segmentation, or SEM/optical imaging.
* Work like an engineer: write readable Python/TypeScript, tests, and docs; use Git; participate in code reviews; iterate fast with the AI lead and domain SMEs.


**Minimum Qualifications**
* BS in CS/EE/CE/ME (or equivalent experience).
* Python proficiency (data wrangling, APIs, packaging); comfort on Linux and with Git.
* Built at least one LLM app using a framework such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Semantic Kernel.
* Hands\\-on with vector search (e.g., FAISS/Weaviate/Milvus) and embeddings; understands chunking, metadata, and hybrid search basics.
* Familiarity with RAG and prompt engineering; can measure quality (groundedness/relevance) and reduce hallucinations.
* Basic backend skills (REST/JSON, auth, environment secrets); experience containerizing with Docker.
* Comfortable reading technical manuals/logs and collaborating with non\\-software teammates.


 Nice to haves
   

  

* Worked with agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI) or implemented tool\\-calling/plan\\-execute loops.
* Built or configured MCP servers to connect LLMs to internal data/tools.
* Experience parsing complex docs (e.g., Unstructured, GROBID) and handling images/figures from manuals.
* Exposure to semiconductor equipment or factory systems (SECS/GEM, EDA/Interface A, MES, SPC); familiarity with KLA/AMAT/TEL/ASML tool ecosystems.
* Time\\-series and log analysis (Pandas, SQL, TimescaleDB/InfluxDB), wafer map/vision background, or simple CV.
* Model adaptation experience (LoRA/QLoRA, PEFT) and experiment tracking (MLflow/W\\&B).
* LLM observability/evals (Ragas, TruLens, LangSmith), basic security/PII handling, and role\\-based access.
* Cloud familiarity (AWS/Azure/GCP) and lightweight front\\-ends (React/Next.js) for internal tools.
* Prior work on fleet\\-level dashboards/analytics or recipe/parameter management.


 What success looks like (first 90 days)
   

  

* Ship a search\\+chat knowledge assistant over our internal docs with clear eval dashboards for faithfulness/relevance.
* Stand up at least one MCP connector to an internal source (e.g., SharePoint/Confluence or log store) and demo safe tool calls.
* Deliver a focused POC: e.g., an agent that reads recent alarms \\& logs to suggest next steps, or a fleet health summary with links to playbooks.
* Document everything (design notes, runbooks, and “how to” guides) and gather field feedback for iteration.


 How we work
   

  

* Pragmatic, security\\-minded, iterate\\-in\\-the\\-open with our engineers.
* We value curiosity, clear writing, and the grit to trace weird edge cases in logs and manuals.


 Apply
   

  

 Send your resume/GitHub/portfolio and a short note about an LLM or agent project you’ve built (what made it work, what you measured, and what you’d improve).

* Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1\\.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.


 Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 75% of the business.
   

  

 Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co\\-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines and many more.

Here’s what they said.**
 At most companies, engineers wait.
   

  

 Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.
   

  

 At Jerry.ai, we don’t wait.
   

  

 If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it — sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us:
 ***“At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.”***
 That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you’ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior — sometimes the same week they ship.
 ***“Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,”***
 said another.
 ***“And things move fast.”***
 We don’t do bureaucracy. We don’t do politics. Everyone here — from our CTO to our tech leads — writes code and sweats the details.
 ***“The leaders here lead by example,”***
 one teammate shared.
 ***“They have very high standards. They don’t settle for just OK.”***
 It’s challenging work, but it’s meaningful. You’ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You’ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly:
 ***“I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.”***
 We’re a remote\\-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.
   

  

**So, what is** 
**Jerry.ai** 
**and why should you care?🤔**
 Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you’ll ever own — and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we’re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we’re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion\\+ problem and we’re the only company tackling it end\\-to\\-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next.
   

  

**What You’ll Work On**
* Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end\\-to\\-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage.
* Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1–2 weeks on average.
* Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules.
* Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re\\-shopping experiences.
* Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in\\-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero.
* Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention.
* Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack.
* Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture.


**Our Tech Stack**
* Frontend \\& backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo
* API: GraphQL
* Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda
* Our business has grown more complex over time. We’re refactoring major parts of our code base — simplifying old systems, rebuilding core flows, and setting up the next three years of our platform’s growth. You’ll help build the foundation for that next phase.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Experience: At least 2 years full stack engineering experience building production\\-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast\\-growing consumer\\-facing software
* Technical strength: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than prior experience with our tech stack.
* Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.
* Ownership: You take responsibility for end\\-to\\-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.
* Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills.
* Curiosity \\+ adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.
