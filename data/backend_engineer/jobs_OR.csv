 At Meshy, we believe 3D creation should be boundless and accessible. Our mission statement is simple:
 **unleash creativity** 
 . We built a
 **full pipeline for 3D content** 
 ranging from text / image to 3D, texturing, texture editing, animation rigging, etc. We also built a vibrant community for our creators, where people can share their work, take inspiration from others, and even use it as an asset marketplace for their games and prototypes. We are the market leader in 3D generative AI, recognized as the
 **No.1** 
 in popularity among 3D AI tools (according to 2024 A16Z Games survey), and we generate real value and is used by enterprises (including Meta, Square Enix, Deepmind, etc.) and millions of end users. Meshy is used in game and film production, in 3D printing, in industrial product design, in enablement of novel product features such as user\\-generated content, and even in training and simulation for robotics and physical AI.
   

  

 Your next challenge
   

  

* Design, build, and maintain high\\-performance AI infrastructure powering our 3D generation models.
* Work closely with researchers to translate model prototypes into reliable, scalable, and production\\-ready serving pipelines.
* Orchestrate GPU\\-accelerated workloads and optimize end\\-to\\-end execution for maximum throughput and utilization.
* Develop and maintain pipeline structures that support versioned algorithms/models, ensuring smooth rollouts and minimal operational overhead.
* Continuously improve system reliability, monitoring, and performance to support rapid iteration in research and production environments.


 What We're Looking For
   

  

* Strong understanding of software engineering and system fundamentals.
* Proficiency in Python and C\\+\\+ for backend and performance\\-critical components.
* Familiarity with model serving interfaces, distributed systems concepts, and basic infra tooling.
* 2\\+ years of professional experience in backend, infra, ML systems, or related engineering roles.


 Nice to Have
   

  

* Experience operating GPU workloads on Kubernetes; exposure to NVIDIA GPU operator, MIG, or GPU\\-related scheduling is a big plus.
* Experience with Golang for infra or platform tooling.
* Understanding of computer graphics, 3D pipelines, or large\\-scale training/serving systems.
* Familiarity with monitoring, tracing, and performance engineering for ML services.


**A Little More About Meshy.ai**
 Trusted by Meta, Square Enix, Deepmind and more, Meshy is redefining 3D creation with generative AI. We empower artists, designers, engineers, hobbyists, and makers to bring immersive worlds, characters, and experiences to reality in minutes instead of months.
   

  

 In Addition To Our Core Mission Of Unleashing Creativity, We Build a Culture That We Enjoy And Are Proud Of. Here Are Some Highlights
   

  

* We value intelligence and the pursuit of knowledge. We are a global team of generative\\-AI pioneers, computer\\-graphics veterans, and product builders who believe human expression and enjoyment is the ultimate frontier of computing.
* We care deeply about our work, our users, and each other. Empathy and passion drive us forward. We have a culture of directness and truthfulness, therefore we value constructive criticism. Being direct and truthful is the most sincere form of trust and care.
* We trust our instincts and are not afraid to take bold risks. Meshy was born from a few\\-hour prototype, a bold pivot for a team that had very little experience in AI. Innovation requires courage.
* We have a keen eye for quality and aesthetics. Our products are not just functional but also beautiful. The same aesthetics permeate through our culture, our code and are the same: functional and beautiful.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/meshyai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGLaabGiXATdA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1732170621072/meshyai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=zaMI_8cipGYGVG3y4wY0KMuBnlCY5Er900F4TNlmgkc","","","","","","","","","","",""
