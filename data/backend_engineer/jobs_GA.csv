 Slack is your Digital HQ – a place where work flows between your people, systems, partners, and customers. From Fortune 100 companies to corner markets, millions of people around the world use Slack to connect their teams, unify their systems, and drive their business forward.
   

  

 Slack breaks down communication silos inside and beyond your organization by bringing teams and tools together around common goals, projects and processes in channels and in Slack Connect. It removes the limits of physical walls, giving people the flexibility to do their best work where, when and how they prefer with features like huddles and clips.

In this digital\\-first era, Slack’s mission is to make people’s work lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive.
   

  

**About The Team**
 This role is on the Quip team, part of the Slack productivity organization. The Quip Product \\& Services team is responsible for all parts of the user and admin facing Quip platform, as well as the Quip APIs. Quip is also the backbone of Slack Canvas. At Quip our priorities are multi pronged: first and foremost we preserve our customer's love and trust by continuing to provide them with the reliable, secure Quip suite they've come to love and depend on over many years to do their work every day. We do that by thoughtfully investing in long term initiatives to harden all parts of the Quip platform while proactively pursuing opportunities to reduce operational and maintenance costs of the platform. Secondly, we leverage our special and longstanding customer relationships and trove of data to identify the most helpful productivity use cases and use that knowledge to guide the design and product development of some of Slack's productivity features.

We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including TypeScript, PHP/Hack, and Python.

We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross\\-functional team of product managers, designers, frontend, iOS, Android, automation, and quality engineers to make Slack a better product. We are looking for engineers that understand that simplicity and reliability are aspects of a system to be carefully calculated with every decision made.
   

  

 Quip Product \\& Services team is responsible for all Quip client apps and the API platform.
   

  

 Slack Productivity suite includes Lists, Huddles, Canvas and Templates, helping organizations consolidate their work in one place.
   

  

 Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?
   

  

**What you will be doing:**
* You’ll brainstorm with Product Managers, Designers, Backend, and Frontend Engineers on your team to conceptualize and build new features for our large (and growing!) user base.
* You’ll produce high\\-quality results by contributing heavily to team projects that have a significant impact on the business.
* You’ll actively own team features or systems and define their long\\-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
* You’ll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving production issues.
* You’ll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
* You’ll improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.


**What you should have:**
* You’ve been building web applications professionally for 5\\+ years.

**About Salesforce**
 Salesforce is the \\#1 AI CRM, where humans with agents drive customer success together. Here, ambition meets action. Tech meets trust. And innovation isn’t a buzzword — it’s a way of life. The world of work as we know it is changing and we're looking for Trailblazers who are passionate about bettering business and the world through AI, driving innovation, and keeping Salesforce's core values at the heart of it all.
   

  

 Ready to level\\-up your career at the company leading workforce transformation in the agentic era? You’re in the right place! Agentforce is the future of AI, and you are the future of Salesforce.
   

  

**About The Team**
 The Slackforce team is at the forefront of a strategic initiative to transform enterprise collaboration by
 **seamlessly integrating Slack and Salesforce** 
 . Our core mission is to redefine how businesses operate, making two of the world’s most widely used platforms feel like one unified, intuitive system.
   

  

 Following Salesforce's acquisition of Slack in December 2020, our work is pivotal in establishing
 **Slack as the primary frontend for the Salesforce platform** 
 . With Slack's acclaimed product and friendly chat\\-based interface, it is also becoming
 **Salesforce’s primary interface for their Agentic AI experience** 
 .
   

  

 As the central pillar driving this integration, we build the connective tissue that brings
 **Salesforce data and workflows directly into Slack** 
 , while embedding
 **Slack conversations directly within the Salesforce UI** 
 . Our focus is on delivering deeply user\\-centric product experiences:
   

  

* We bring the 20% of Salesforce features that users utilize 80% of the time directly into the Slack interface, empowering sellers to update account, opportunity, and deal records, and progress their sales motions directly from their flow of work in Slack.
* We are building Salesforce Channels, an innovative feature that links a Salesforce record (structured data) to a Slack channel (unstructured data). This enables Slack to pull structured data from Salesforce into the channel view, where users can directly edit information, trigger workflows, and automate notifications based on record updates. Check out what we are building in this video: https://salesforce.vidyard.com/watch/YjHzKRijCi9r9VYo82CVJq


 We are a team of
 **product engineers who deeply care about the user experience** 
 . We are seeking
 **product\\-driven backend engineers** 
 with strong intuition and experience who build systems and design APIs with the
 **end user in mind** 
 . Our ideal candidates are collaborative, partnering closely with product managers, designers, and frontend/mobile engineers to
 **conceptualize and build new features** 
 . You will be instrumental in designing and owning systems and APIs that directly shape Slack’s product experience, ensuring they are
 **scalable, performant, and precisely tailored to real user needs** 
 , while making smart trade\\-offs between speed, cost, and user experience. We value engineers who understand that simplicity and reliability are carefully calculated aspects of system design.
   

  

 We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including PHP/Hack, Java, MySQL, and Linux. Expertise in these areas is a huge plus, but having familiarity with other common web languages (such as Python or Ruby) and other relational databases are fine substitutes.
   

  

**What you will be doing:**
* You'll brainstorm with Product Managers, Designers, Backend, and Frontend Engineers on your team to conceptualize and build new features for our large (and growing!) user base.
* You’ll produce high\\-quality results by contributing heavily to team projects that have a significant impact on the business.
* You’ll actively own team features or systems and define their long\\-term health, while also improving the health of surrounding systems.
* You'll assist our skilled support team and operations team in triaging and resolving production issues.
* You'll mentor other engineers and deeply review code.
* You’ll improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.


**What you should have:**
* A related technical degree required
* You’ve been building web applications professionally for 7\\+ years.
* You have experience with functional or imperative programming languages — e.g., PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, or C.
* You can contribute to technical architecture discussions and help drive technical decisions within your team.
* You write understandable, testable code with an eye towards maintainability.
* You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you.
* You possess solid computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages, distributed systems, and information retrieval.
* You embrace the hybrid working model; collaborating in office at least 10 days per quarter.

* **Device fleet operations** 
 for pharmacy hardware: inventory, health checks, secure connectivity, staged rollouts.


 First\\-year outcomes

* Related technical degree required.
* A demonstrated track record of spotting issues in complex codebases and transforming them into successful, high\\-impact projects.

* Experience working closely with product teams, designers, and other developers to create a truly delightful mobile experience
* Current and detailed knowledge of the capabilities of different iOS API levels
* Experience developing highly performant Swift/Objective\\-C code and view layouts and the ability to diagnose performance bottlenecks

Here’s what they said.**
 At most companies, engineers wait.
   

  

 Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.
   

  

 At Jerry.ai, we don’t wait.
   

  

 If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it — sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us:
 ***“At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.”***
 That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you’ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior — sometimes the same week they ship.
 ***“Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,”***
 said another.
 ***“And things move fast.”***
 We don’t do bureaucracy. We don’t do politics. Everyone here — from our CTO to our tech leads — writes code and sweats the details.
 ***“The leaders here lead by example,”***
 one teammate shared.
 ***“They have very high standards. They don’t settle for just OK.”***
 It’s challenging work, but it’s meaningful. You’ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You’ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly:
 ***“I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.”***
 We’re a remote\\-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.
   

  

**So, what is** 
**Jerry.ai** 
**and why should you care?🤔**
 Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you’ll ever own — and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we’re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we’re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion\\+ problem and we’re the only company tackling it end\\-to\\-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next.
   

  

**What You’ll Work On**
* Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end\\-to\\-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage.
* Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1–2 weeks on average.
* Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules.
* Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re\\-shopping experiences.
* Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in\\-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero.
* Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention.
* Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack.
* Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture.


**Our Tech Stack**
* Frontend \\& backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo
* API: GraphQL
* Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda
* Our business has grown more complex over time. We’re refactoring major parts of our code base — simplifying old systems, rebuilding core flows, and setting up the next three years of our platform’s growth. You’ll help build the foundation for that next phase.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Experience: At least 2 years full stack engineering experience building production\\-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast\\-growing consumer\\-facing software
* Technical strength: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than prior experience with our tech stack.
* Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.
* Ownership: You take responsibility for end\\-to\\-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.
* Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills.
* Curiosity \\+ adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.


 This isn’t another coding job.
 **You’ll work in a flexible** 
 , fast\\-moving, and
 **highly** 
**collaborative** 
**culture** 
 , where
 **innovation** 
**is** 
**encouraged** 
 ,
 **your voice is heard** 
 , and the
 **impact of your work is immediate** 
 . You’ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn, and grow alongside talented peers.

Here’s what they said.**
 At most companies, engineers wait.
   

  

 Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.
   

  

 At Jerry.ai, we don’t wait.
   

  

 If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it — sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us:
 ***“At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.”***
 That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you’ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior — sometimes the same week they ship.
 ***“Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,”***
 said another.
 ***“And things move fast.”***
 We don’t do bureaucracy. We don’t do politics. Everyone here — from our CTO to our tech leads — writes code and sweats the details.
 ***“The leaders here lead by example,”***
 one teammate shared.
 ***“They have very high standards. They don’t settle for just OK.”***
 It’s challenging work, but it’s meaningful. You’ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You’ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly:
 ***“I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.”***
 We’re a remote\\-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.
   

  

**So, what is** 
**Jerry.ai** 
**and why should you care?🤔**
 Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you’ll ever own — and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we’re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we’re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion\\+ problem and we’re the only company tackling it end\\-to\\-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we’re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M → 50M users next.
   

  

**What You’ll Work On**
* Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end\\-to\\-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage.
* Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1–2 weeks on average.
* Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules.
* Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re\\-shopping experiences.
* Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in\\-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero.
* Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention.
* Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack.
* Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture.


**Our Tech Stack**
* Frontend \\& backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo
* API: GraphQL
* Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis
* Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda
* Our business has grown more complex over time. We’re refactoring major parts of our code base — simplifying old systems, rebuilding core flows, and setting up the next three years of our platform’s growth. You’ll help build the foundation for that next phase.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Experience: At least 5 years full stack engineering experience building production\\-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast\\-growing consumer\\-facing software
* Technical strength: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than prior experience with our tech stack.
* Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.
* Ownership: You take responsibility for end\\-to\\-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.
* Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills.
* Curiosity \\+ adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.


 This isn’t another coding job.
 **You’ll work in a flexible** 
 , fast\\-moving, and
 **highly** 
**collaborative** 
**culture** 
 , where
 **innovation** 
**is** 
**encouraged** 
 ,
 **your voice is heard** 
 , and the
 **impact of your work is immediate** 
 . You’ll tackle meaningful challenges, learn, and grow alongside talented peers.

 At Scribd (pronounced “scribbed”), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our four products: Everand, Scribd, Slideshare, and Fable.
   

  

 We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.
   

  

 When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It’s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees – in partnership with their manager – can choose the daily work\\-style that best suits their individual needs.

For this reason, occasional in\\-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.
