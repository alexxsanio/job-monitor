* Develop AI\\-first solutions that provide genuine customer impact, while preserving and enhancing what makes the horticulture industry so unique.
* Contribute to engineering best practices and help shape a collaborative, high\\-quality development culture.
* Collaborate closely with Bloomlogic leadership to provide technical input, contribute to the roadmap, and help translate product goals into practical engineering execution.


**What We’re Looking For:**
* Ownership mindset – strong sense of accountability, resourcefulness, and the ability to execute independently in a fast\\-moving, but deeply impactful environment.
* Customer\\-obsessed engineering mindset \\- relentless focus on building elegant, user\\-friendly solutions for complex problems; you sweat the details that actually make a difference to customers and avoid ""shiny object syndrome"".
* Solid technical skills across the stack – an experienced full\\-stack engineer comfortable building scalable systems. Exposure to our tech stack (Next.js, Typescript, React, Postgres) is preferred, but strictly secondary to knowledge and experience with software engineering best practices.
* Proven track record – experience delivering high\\-quality products or features in fast\\-paced, growth\\-oriented environments, with increasing responsibility and measurable impact.
* Bias for shipping – you move with urgency, make intelligent trade\\-offs, and understand that value is created by what you deploy, not what you design; you balance efficient use of AI\\-assisted coding tools with your core engineering skills to ensure both quality and speed.
* Strong technical and communication skills – excitement to write high\\-quality code, collaborate effectively across teams, and take ownership of critical features and systems.
* Passion for agriculture – building alongside folks with a passion for the industry is a huge plus!
* Professional, respectful collaborator – Team player who fosters psychological safety, dependability, clear communication, structure, and purpose (Refer to Google’s ""Project Aristotle"" for more info.)


**What We Offer:**
* An equity stake in a high\\-potential, venture\\-backed startup poised to define its category.
* Support from a world\\-class venture studio; Philo's Venture Studio provides meaningful support to the Bloomlogic team, from back\\-office (funding, legal, etc.) to marketing, so the founding team can focus entirely on building and taking to market a legendary product.
* Competitive salary and comprehensive benefits.
* A culture of deep work and autonomy; this is a role for a builder who wants ownership, not oversight.
* Unlimited PTO and support for a healthy lifestyle.
* A collaborative, mission\\-driven environment with direct access to seasoned founders and technical advisors.

 pmtbox is building payments that
 **actually**
 work for the businesses that depend on them. After years of building and scaling payments companies — and with decades of fraud, risk, and merchant\\-ops experience on our founding team — we’re creating a platform centered on one simple idea: merchants deserve clarity, control, and outcomes that drive their growth.
   

  

 We’re a merchant\\-first company. That means we prioritize transparency, unlock the data others obscure, and build tools that give merchants a real edge. We move fast, sweat the details, and build with intent — always focused on making payments the most powerful tool in commerce.
   

  

 We’re growing quickly and looking for people who think like founders, act with ownership, and want to build something that lasts.
   

  

****Why This Role Exists****
 We’re hiring a Senior Engineer to help build the core foundation of pmtbox. This is a full\\-stack role within a flat engineering team where you will work directly on payments, integrations, risk systems, infrastructure, and databases.
   

  

 You’ll own a spoke end to end — from design to build to launch. This requires a birds\\-eye understanding of our unified payment architecture, paired with the willingness to get into the weeds and ship real product. We are not hiring a manager. We are hiring a builder.
   

  

**What You’ll Work On**
* End\\-to\\-end ownership of a spoke in our hub\\-and\\-spoke architecture.
* Full\\-stack development across backend, frontend, data, infrastructure, and integrations.
* Contributing to the evolution of our unified payments layer.
* Building merchant\\-facing tools, payment routing logic, fintech plumbing, and risk\\-adjacent systems.
* Working closely with founders and engineering to shape architecture and product direction.
* Shipping thoughtful, reliable code that moves the business forward.


**What You’ll Bring**
* Senior\\-level engineering experience (no specific year count required).
* Experience in fintech/payments or from the merchant side — ideally someone who has lived the pain points we’re solving.
* Comfort in early\\-stage environments and the fast pace that comes with them.
* Curiosity and willingness to learn our stack:
* 
+ Ruby on Rails (experience not required — curiosity and willingness to learn is)
+ JavaScript
+ Google Cloud
+ Postgres

* Ability to think in systems and understand how your work fits into the larger architecture.
* A bias for action, ownership, and solving real problems without layers or bureaucracy.


****Nice to Have****
* Experience with payment routing, card acquiring, underwriting/risk tools, or financial operations systems.
* Experience with multi\\-tenant systems, real\\-time workflows, or complex integrations.
* Familiarity with cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, or observability.


**How We Work**
 pmtbox functions primarily in\\-office in Orem, UT. We value focus, clarity, and collaboration — and our in\\-office rhythm supports that. That said, for exceptional engineers, we’re open to evaluating remote applications.
   

  

**Compensation \\& Benefits**
* Compensation is in line with senior\\-level experience
* Equity participation is included in the compensation package
* $2,000 in Monthly QSEHRA reimbursement toward health insurance
* Safe Harbor 401(k) with 100% match up to 6%
* In\\-office snacks and drinks
* Bi\\-Weekly Friday team lunch with leadership
