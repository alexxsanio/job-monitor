 ACA Group is the leading governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) advisor in financial services. What sets us apart is the breadth and depth of our integrated platform — we offer the most comprehensive compliance technology platform on the market integrating over a dozen purpose\\-built modules. Our competitors offer only one or two.
   

  

 We also operate on a unique User/Provider Model: our technology is used not only by our clients but also internally across our managed services and advisory practices. This creates a powerful feedback loop — every enhancement is grounded in firsthand experience, driving real\\-world performance and usability.
   

  

  

* Location: Must reside in the Raleigh/Durham area
* Note: This role will begin as remote and transitioning to a hybrid model in the future.


**Role Overview**
 We’re building a full\\-stack technology team to drive our platform forward and are hiring at all levels of experience. Whether you’re an early\\-career developer or a seasoned architect, you’ll help shape a next\\-generation platform at the intersection of finance, technology and AI.
   

  

 We’re looking for voracious learners, intuitive problem solvers, and people who are just as interested in understanding the “why” behind the business as the “how” behind the code. If you’re intensely curious and driven to master both technology and the domain it serves, ACA is the place to do it.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Design and implement cloud\\-native software used by top\\-tier financial institutions.
* Work across the stack — from front\\-end UX to back\\-end services and infrastructure.
* Collaborate with product managers, compliance experts, and clients to solve high\\-impact problems.
* Apply AI and automation thoughtfully, always keeping human context in the loop.
* Engage in continuous learning — about new tech, financial markets, and emerging regulatory challenges.


**Who You Are**
* Intensely curious and motivated by the pursuit of mastery — at the intersection of technology and finance.
* A self\\-starter who thrives in fast\\-paced, collaborative environments.
* Excited by the complexity of financial systems and the opportunity to build tools that make them safer and more efficient.
* Experienced in software development, but not limited by title or background — we care more about how you think than what’s on your résumé.


**Our Technology**
 Our platform is a
 **fully cloud\\-native** 
 ,
 **globally distributed SaaS solution** 
 architected for scale, security, and flexibility. We use a modern stack of containerized microservices, real\\-time data pipelines, and API\\-first services designed for extensibility.
   

  

 We embed
 **AI throughout the platform** 
 , powering automation, intelligent risk detection, and smarter workflows — always with a
 **human\\-in\\-the\\-loop** 
 to ensure quality and accountability. Our software supports a wide array of compliance functions including surveillance, testing, marketing review, and more.

 General Atomics Integrated Intelligence, Inc. (GA\\-Intelligence), an affiliate of General Atomics, maintains and deploys production systems for users across the Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, and commercial industry. We build and develop best\\-in\\-class all domain and globally focused situational awareness capabilities, including THRESHER and DRAGONSPELL, that process petabytes of data from numerous streaming data sources in near real time. Our systems apply state\\-of\\-the\\-art algorithms and machine learning techniques to extract features and fuse data from multiple phenomenologies to form a rich live view of objects in the sky, on the sea, and on the ground. These analytics are designed to determine not just where something is, but what it is, where it's been and what it's doing. We're dedicated to transforming data into actionable insights through innovative system engineering approaches. We always want to do more, and that's where you come in!
   

  

****Why GA\\-Intelligence?****
 At GA\\-Intelligence, we’re not chasing hype or building throwaway demos—we’re solving complex, mission\\-critical problems that matter. Unlike younger firms chasing the next funding round, we’ve spent decades earning the trust of our users and delivering systems they rely on every day. And unlike traditional defense contractors, we’re nimble, privately held, and able to make long\\-term decisions in the best interest of our customers and our country—not quarterly earnings reports.
   

  

 Our users love our software. Our customers come back because we deliver. And our engineers stay because they get to work on real problems, with real impact, alongside people who care.
   

  

 If you're looking for a place where engineering excellence meets enduring mission, GA\\-I3 is where you belong.
   

  

****What You’ll Do****
 We are seeking Backend Software Engineers to help build the next generation of global situational awareness and battle orchestration capabilities. You’ll collaborate with cross\\-functional teams—including UI/UX engineers, mission engineers, data scientists, and product owners—to design and deliver software that is performant, scalable, and tailored to complex user needs.
   

  

 Whether you're integrating multi\\-source data, optimizing backend services, or shaping how insights reach the end user, your work will directly support operational missions that have real\\-world impact.
   

  

****What We Believe****
 These values weren’t crafted in a branding session—they were observed and articulated after 35 years of building software that matters. They reflect how we work, what we value in each other, and the kind of impact we want to have. At GA\\-Intelligence, they aren’t aspirational—they’re how we operate.
   

  

* Solving Meaningful Challenges – Building mission\\-driven technology that makes a difference
* Collaborative Culture – Working as a team to push boundaries and innovate
* Technical Excellence – Encouraging continuous learning, curiosity, and efficiency
* Idea Meritocracy – Valuing ideas based on impact, not hierarchy


 If these principles resonate with you—not just in theory, but in daily practice—you’ll find yourself at home here.
   

  

**Duties And Responsibilities**
 At GA\\-Intelligence, we view entry\\-level engineers not just as contributors, but as long\\-term investments in our future. You’ll be given opportunities to make real contributions to active projects while receiving mentorship, structured training, and support for your growth. We expect junior engineers to learn quickly, ask questions, and take initiative as they build confidence and capability on the job.
   

  

* Implement, document, test, and deploy software for a variety of systems with support from more experienced engineers
* Develop and maintain test scripts and frameworks to validate software functionality
* Debug and update deployed software in customer facilities and cloud environments to keep pace with evolving requirements and technologies

* Grow technical skills through team collaboration, pair programming, mentoring, company training, and funded personal development


 We recognize and appreciate the value and contributions of individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences and welcome all qualified individuals to apply.

* Understanding of basic software development principles and version control systems (e.g., Git)
* Strong desire to learn and grow in a mission\\-focused engineering environment
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills
