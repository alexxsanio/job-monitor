 More about Recidiviz
   

  

 Recidiviz was an all\\-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A\\-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y\\-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.
   

  

 Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 18 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice\\-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

**Our mission is to reinvent the way people learn, starting with language.**
 Learning a language can change a life by opening doors to new cultures, careers, and communities. Two billion people around the world are actively trying to learn a language, but the best way to learn (one\\-on\\-one tutoring) is hard to access at scale and hasn’t been meaningfully improved in decades. Speak is building a human\\-level, AI\\-powered tutor in your pocket: a conversation\\-first experience that lets learners actually speak, get instant feedback, and progress through carefully designed lessons. The result is a complete path from beginner to confident speaker across multiple languages.
   

  

 Speak first launched in South Korea in 2019, where Speak has now become the number one language learning app, and we now serve learners across many markets and 15\\+ languages. Speak is one of the world’s leading AI companies, with over $150m raised in venture investment from OpenAI, Accel, Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, and more, with a distributed team across San Francisco, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, and Ljubljana.
   

  

**About This Role**
 We are seeking a true
 **full\\-stack engineer** 
 who is comfortable working across the stack. While initial projects may lean more toward the frontend, we expect this role to pivot into backend work as well, contributing to the development of novel AI\\-powered product experiences.
   

  

 The ideal candidate will have experience working in close coordination with product, design, and machine learning teams, as well as have a background in building polished consumer applications. This role sits at the center of developing our newest products focused on programmatic, conversationally\\-driven language learning and will be an instrumental contributor to the future of our company.
   

  

 What you'll be doing
   

  

* Building novel AI\\-driven product experiences and user interfaces on the web
* Owning the entire development cycle of features, from conception to production
* You'll be able to write code very quickly, ship frequently, and make a huge impact on our business by helping us scale our content


 What we're looking for
   

  

* 4\\+ years of experience building highly polished web\\-based product experiences, including extensive experience with React
* You appreciate balancing doing things the ""right way"" but also can build things scrappily if necessary
* You enjoy shipping things quickly and frequently
* You're an excellent communicator and enjoy collaborating with people across all functions
* We welcome applicants across all levels of engineering, including mid, senior, and staff.


 Office
   

  

* San Francisco, CA


**Why work at Speak**
* Join a fantastic, tight\\-knit team at the right time: we're growing very quickly, we've most recently raised our Series C from some of the top investors in the valley, and we've achieved product\\-market fit in our initial markets. You'd join at a magical time when a single person could significantly change the course of the company.
* Do your life's work with people you’ll love working with: we care strongly about our craft and want every person at Speak to feel like they're growing every day. We believe in the idea that working with people you both enjoy and have respect for makes everything better. We hire thoughtfully and only work with people we admire deeply.
* Global in nature: We're live in over 40 countries and launching in a number of new markets soon. We have dedicated offices in San Francisco, Ljubljana, Seoul, and Tokyo, and you’ll have the opportunity to talk to users in each of these regions on a regular basis as well as travel.
* Impact people's lives in a major way: Learning a language is one of the single most life\\-changing skills one can learn, and right now 99% of people never achieve their goal because the process is broken. We’re helping millions of people achieve their goals and improve their lives.

 Muro AI is transforming how the $2T construction industry plans and builds. Founded by Cornell alumni, ex\\-founders, and former McKinsey operators, we’re building AI agents that automate the most complex, manual, and costly phase of construction: preconstruction.
 



  





 We move fast, build with conviction, and obsess over delivering real impact to the people who build our world. If you want to shape how the next century of construction gets built, this is where it starts.
 



  





**Who You Are** 




 A true builder with 4\\+ years of technical experience. You’ve lived the 0→1 chaos \\- maybe you co\\-founded something, or led a team through the trenches. You know that the good (fast growth) and the ugly (2 AM patches) come with the territory. You’re scrappy, curious, and energized by uncharted problems.
 



  





**Why It Matters** 



* Shape a category. No one owns “pre\\-con AI” yet — we’re charting that map.
* Bridge two worlds. Effect changes in an estimator’s spreadsheet with multimodal models that understand construction documents.
* Drive impact. Your AI agents will help contractors close multi\\-million\\-dollar bids and save hundreds of hours per project.



  





**Your Mission** 



* Build agentic workflows that work. Create agents to complete multi\\-step construction tasks. Implement tool use for Procore APIs, Excel manipulation, and document generation. Build agents that read plans, update budgets, and generate RFIs autonomously.
* Ship production RAG systems. Process 1,500\\-page plan sets. Build pipelines that understand construction specs and drawings. Handle messy, real\\-world documents \\- scanned, rotated, hand\\-marked. Deliver semantic search that actually finds the door schedule on page 347\\.
* Embed with customers. Sit with estimators during bid week. Understand workflows, then turn “we manually compare 50 subcontractor bids” into an intelligent agent.
* Own the AI stack. Python services orchestrating model calls. Celery workers for long\\-running jobs. Vector DBs for semantic search. Context engineering, evaluation frameworks, and monitoring for quality. Dockerized workloads on GCP infra.

**How We’re Different**
 Etched believes in the Bitter Lesson. We think most of the progress in the AI field has come from using more FLOPs to train and run models, and the best way to get more FLOPs is to build model\\-specific hardware. Larger and larger training runs encourage companies to consolidate around fewer model architectures, which creates a market for single\\-model ASICs.
